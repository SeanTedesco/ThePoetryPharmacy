The spider\n felt the threads of all being vibrate\n through him \u2014 and so it vowed to be the answer\n\n to the prayer of the man praying to his father\n to let this cup pass. But on the cross, when the man cried out\n to his father not to abandon him, his father\n\n did abandon him.

{"poem": "Three, no, four, that I know, married women\n of means and brains. One grew moss on her tongue, waking from dreams that smelled\n of mildew or hoary socks on a smothering train.\n One turned to falconry and the construction of seed bombs to be dropped from three-\n story\u00a0houses. One burned her burka upon being released\n from prison for the fourth time shamed so down deep in her molested self, washed\n henceforth in formal darkness, another burned\n her wedding dress in a fire pot while house finches splashed in the birdbath. [how one\nmoment touches on another moment and a thought flickers on and off ]\n One poet, obsessed with vulvae, son of a butcher,\n displayed a large bezoar on his coffee table, and slept in the bear nests in the d\u2019Ard\u00e8che,\n obsessed. One poet, adopted shortly after birth\n by a levee builder on the St. Francis, shot himself with a target pistol on a beautiful\n afternoon in early June. One lay across the tracks\n on the brink of the Tiananmen uprising. One picked up her manuscript, a block of ash,\n from the embers of her Oakland home. Bakhtin, as we know,\n smoked his very best pages in prison. The poems of Radn\u00f3ti were found by his widow in\n his overcoat, in a mass grave. One scribbled until his last\n conscious breath in an apartment in Waltham, brimmed over with hellish fury and\n dysfunctional passion. One was imprisoned on a ship\n in Valparaiso during the military coup, but lived with his \u201ciron bad health\u201d to carve a\n poem 3.5 kilometers long in the Atacama Desert,\n and another in the skies over Brooklyn; to cover thousands of pages with anguish and\n light. One is fascinated with lichens and other symbionts.\n One with fungi and other entheogens. [how the divine is elusive and pelf is conspicuous]\n One spent the better part of this life\n writing in the dirt with a stick, crossing out with his foot, that his entire tribe could decipher\n the mystery inscribed. [Another surrendered\nhis youth and gladness with lines of despondency and madness.] One broke faith with the word\n before the word could break faith with her, and built\n a mountain of detergent in her garage. One made a record of night-flying birds on a scroll\n longer than the roll of post-Katrina homicides\n in Orleans Parish. One does not like white flowers and has never\n shown her poems to a single solitary living soul. Another built a pair of metal wings to be\n worn once and then pressed between the covers\n of a golden book. One joined the Int\u2019l Concatenated Order of the Hoo-Hoo but\n absconded for Europe where he lives large\n as an unaffiliated psychedelic narcissist. Some just want the big life. Others suffer\n into the night at the thought of what\n they should have said, un autre esprit d\u2019escalier. One was able to buy his first car\n after a settlement from being bit by a pit bull.\n One resolved to trim her hair once she began to sit upon it.\n One walked alone from Savannah to Santa Monica. The perfect time to read\n the Bible and Gravity\u2019s Rainbow. One posed under a tortuosa beech at Arnold\n Arboretum when her picture was taken; wrote\n longhand crossing the Gulf, got a job statuing in New Orleans. One of the venerated\n continues to write though his sight has abandoned\n him and his garden is returning to wilderness. One snores and never locks her doors.\n One has lamellar ichthyosis and did not shed her collodion\n membrane. Rare relief springs from poetry and lying flat, cloud-searching on the grass.\n [how a glass ear is fashioned from words]\n One poet goes silent as fishes; one stands in a lightning field and slowly begins to move.\n [as a fugue composed in an open boat]\n One writes again every thousand+ days and plants all things magenta, so named\n for the Italian town of that name.\n One, as a lock against beggary and death, writes only elegies; was advised by a mild elder:\n It is all right to be depressed just as long\n as you don\u2019t let it get you down. [how wisteria can bring down a house/likewise cat\u2019s claw]\n One dreamed of leaving her colicky son\n under the bleachers. One survived multiple tumors in his brain decades after a year-long\n tour in Vietnam. Another walked off\n the uranium fields, survived melanoma and many more unkind cuts, torn awake.\n How here: [The story has a skip in it.

{"poem": "1. brett returns my mother to the wilderness\n\nI slipped them into my friend\u2019s palm\u2009\u2014\u2009\nthe tiny crucifix, and dove,\nfrom off my mother\u2019s pendant watch\u2009\u2014\u2009\nand I asked her to walk them up through the brush\ntoward timberline, and find a place \nto hurl them, for safekeeping. Now,\nshe writes, \u201cI walked up the canyon at dusk,\nwarm, with a touch of fall blowing down the canyon,\ncame to an outcrop, above a steep\ndrop\u2009\u2014\u2009far below, a seasonal\ncreek, green willows. I stood on a boulder\nand held out my hand. I wished your mother all the\nlove in the world, and I sent the talismans\nflying off the cliff. They were so small,\nand the wind was blowing, so I never saw or\nheard them land.\u201d My mother is where\nI cannot find her, she is gone beyond\nrecall, she lies in her sterling shapes\nlight as the most weightless bone in the body, her\nstirrup bone, which was ground up \nand sown into the sea. I do not know\nwhat a soul is, I think of it \nas the smallest, the core, civil right. And she\nis wild now with it, she touches and is\ntouched by no one knows\u2009\u2014\u2009down, or\ndroppings of a common nighthawk,\nroot of bird\u2019s foot fern, antenna of\nHairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by the\nhuge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There was\nsomething deeply right about \nthe physical elements\u2009\u2014\u2009atoms, and cells,\nand marrow\u2009\u2014\u2009of my mother\u2019s body,\nwhen I was young, and now her delicate\ninsignias receive the direct\ntouch of the sun, and scatter it,\nunseen, all over her home.\n\n\n\n2. cross and dove\n2. cross and dove\n\n I had not wanted them, and I hadn\u2019t known\n what to do with them, the minuscule\n symbols of my mother\u2019s religion,\n I looked for a crack in the stone floor of the\n cathedral but could not find one. Then I thought\n of the wilderness near Desolation,\n and asked my friend to carry them up\n to a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Since\n then, it has been as if my mother\u2019s\n spirit matter has been returned\n into the great bank of matter,\n as her marrow had been sifted down into\n the ocean. It doesn\u2019t matter, now, if I\n ever wanted to disassemble\n my mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-\n across cross, and the silver line drawing\n of a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhere\n to be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and how\n long the soul-dolls of her trust will last in their\n spider-egg-sac of roots, needles,\n quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shed\n claw. Her belief she would have an eternal\n life was absolute, I think.\n It would not be good to think of my mother\n without her God \u2014 like a hermit howling in the\n moonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old \u2014 like an\n exquisite child playing a crone\n in the school play \u2014 we talked about heaven.\n She wasn\u2019t sure exactly how, but she\n knew her father would be there, and her elder\n brother, and her second husband \u2014\n maybe it was a heaven for four,\n the three men and her. It was so\n easy to make my mother happy\n in her last years, to tell her that I\n could just see her, as a kitten, in God\u2019s\n lap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with more\n beams than any other eyes I have seen.\n I have sent the tokens of her everlasting being\n into the high altitude.\n They will shine long after I can sing her \u2014 sing what I\n perceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.\n I don\u2019t know if I saw my mother\n or did not see her.

Who\nknows\u2009\u2014\u2009he and the other I mistook, at first, for a bat.\n\nThey called to me\u2009\u2014\u2009something between squawk and chirp,\nsomething between song and prayer\u2009\u2014\u2009to do something, \n\nanything. And, like any good god, I disappeared. Not \nindifferent, exactly. But with things to do. And, most likely, \n\non my way home from another heartbreak. Call it 1997,\nand say I\u2019m several thousand miles from home. By which\n\nI mean those were the days I made of everyone a love song.\nBy which I mean I was lonely and unrequited. But that\u2019s\n\nnot quite it either. Truth is, I did manage to find a few\nto love me, but couldn\u2019t always love them back. The Rasta\n\nlaw professor. The firefighter\u2019s wife. The burlesque dancer\nwhose daughter blackened drawings with ms to mean\n\nthe sky was full of birds the day her daddy died. I think\nhis widow said he drowned one morning on a fishing trip.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m digressing. But if you asked that night\u2009\u2014\u2009\ndid I mention it was night?\u2009\u2014\u2009why I didn\u2019t even try\n\nto jimmy the lock to spring the sparrow, I couldn\u2019t say,\ntruthfully, that it had anything to do with envy, with wanting\n\na woman to plead as deeply for me as these sparrows did, \none for the other. No. I\u2019d have said something, instead,\n\nabout the neighborhood itself, the car thief shot a block\nand a half east the week before. Or about the men\n\nI came across nights prior, sweat-slicked and shirtless,\ngrappling in the middle of the street, the larger one\u2019s chest\n\npressed to the back of the smaller, bruised and bleeding\nboth. I know you thought this was about birds, \n\nbut stay with me. I left them both in the street\u2009\u2014\u2009\nthe same street where I\u2019d leave the sparrows\u2009\u2014\u2009the men\n\nembracing and, for all one knows (especially one not\nfrom around there), they could have been lovers\u2009\u2014\u2009\n\nthe one whispering an old, old tune into the ear \nof the other\u2009\u2014\u2009Baby, baby, don\u2019t leave me this way. I left\n\nthe men where I\u2019d leave the sparrows and their song.\nAnd as I walked away, I heard one of the men call to me,\n\nplease or help or brother or some such. And I didn\u2019t break\nstride, not one bit. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve learned to save myself.\n\nLet me try this another way. Call it 1977. And say\nI\u2019m back west, South Central Los Angeles. My mother\n\nand father at it again. But this time in the street,\nbroad daylight, and all the neighbors watching. One,\n\nI think his name was Sonny, runs out from his duplex\nto pull my father off. You see where I\u2019m going with this? \n\nMy mother crying out, fragile as a sparrow. Sonny\nfighting my father, fragile as a sparrow. And me,\n\nyears later, trying to get it all down. As much for you\u2009\u2014\u2009\nI\u2019m saying\u2009\u2014\u2009as for me. Sonny catches a left, lies flat\n\non his back, blood starting to pool and his own\nwife wailing. My mother wailing, and traffic backed,\n\nnow, half a block. Horns, whistles, and soon sirens. \n1977. Summer. And all the trees full of birds. Hundreds,\n\nI swear. And since I\u2019m the one writing it, I\u2019ll tell you\nthey were crying. Which brings me back to Dolphy\n\nand his transcribing. The jazzman, I think, wanted only\nto get it down pure. To get it down exact\u2009\u2014\u2009the animal\n\nracking itself against a car\u2019s steel door, the animals\nin the trees reporting, the animals we make of ourselves\n\nand one another. Stay with me now. Don\u2019t leave me.\nDays after the dustup, my parents took me to the park.\n\nAnd in this park was a pond, and in this pond were birds.\nNot sparrows, but swans. And my father spread a blanket\n\nand brought from a basket some apples and a paring knife.\nSummertime. My mother wore sunglasses. And long sleeves.\n\nMy father, now sober, cursed himself for leaving the radio.\nBut my mother forgave him, and said, as she caressed\n\nthe back of his hand, that we could just listen to the swans.\nAnd we listened. And I watched. Two birds coupling,\n\none beating its wings as it mounted the other. Summer,\n1977. I listened. And watched. When my parents made love\n\nlate into that night, I covered my ears in the next room,\nscanning the encyclopedia for swans. It meant nothing to me\u2009\u2014\u2009\n\nthen, at least\u2009\u2014\u2009but did you know the collective noun\nfor swans is a lamentation? And is a lamentation not\n\nits own species of song? What a woman wails, punch drunk\nin the street? Or what a widow might sing, learning her man\n\nwas drowned by swans? A lamentation of them? Imagine\nthe capsized boat, the panicked man, struck about the eyes,\n\nnose, and mouth each time he comes up for air. Imagine\nthe birds coasting away and the waters suddenly calm.\n\nEither trumpet swans or mutes. The dead man\u2019s wife\nrunning for help, crying to any who\u2019d listen. A lamentation.\n\nAnd a city busy saving itself. I\u2019m digressing, sure. But \ndid you know that to digress means to stray from the flock?\n\nWhen I left my parents\u2019 house, I never looked back. By which\nI mean I made like a god and disappeared. As when I left\n\nthe sparrows. And the copulating swans. As when someday\nI\u2019ll leave this city. Its every flailing, its every animal song.\n", "title": "Upon Reading That Eric Dolphy Transcribed Even the Calls of Certain Species of Birds,", "id": 58805, "author": "John Murillo"}

There is no God in you,\nthe deep-time of a dog year is enough.\nAnd lately you are wiser than all zero.\nDear dog, creaking like a haunted house,\nI will consider you, from bucking young\n\u2019un to patient as settling porter; how you\nheld the pack when Fat Man was small\nand a zoomy nuisance of wriggling. I will\nconsider your narrow self, aslant against\nmy chest in grief, in grieving, overwhelmed,\nwhen you were the busy broom that swept\nthe pieces of me together. Yes, I will\nconsider the yellow dog, his bestowing\nsnout in the chill a.m.; his royal cheek\nand his dances. A yellow dog comes only\nonce and is hisself: brilliant, final, and entire.\n", "title": "And I will consider the yellow dog", "id": 58568, "author": "Fran Lock"}
{"poem": "So many names, my mother, I\u2019m never sure\n \u00a0 \u00a0what to call you. So many names for all your predators\n \u00a0 \u00a0and crushes and suitors. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m here and I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not here.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Would you have made it on your own\n \u00a0 \u00a0without the comorbid condition of motherhood\n \u00a0 \u00a0and the slowness and consistency of time?\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the slowness and consistency of time;\n \u00a0 \u00a0years like zombies dawdling toward a cliff edge\n \u00a0 \u00a0holding back the child\u2019s writhing body, itching to grow, packed\n \u00a0 \u00a0around the same mind I have now.\n\nI\u2019m sorry the concept of promise outgrew the concept of child\n \u00a0 \u00a0and that systemic contradiction and wizardry left only a dim sense\n \u00a0 \u00a0of suspicion; a crescendoing breeze, accumulating clouds\n \u00a0 \u00a0amidst bewildering dichotomies.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for resembling your relatives and captors and the man\n \u00a0 \u00a0who penetrated you, who\u2019s still there, communicating boldly\n \u00a0 \u00a0via intersections of others\u2019 thought waves and memories,\n \u00a0 \u00a0blatant into the long nights, haunting,\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0for my inferiority in the face of nuclear family culture,\n \u00a0 \u00a0feeding on detritus of white goods, leisure sports, laminate \ufb02oors,\n \u00a0 \u00a0a real home and fake recycling,\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0for creeping by night into a tight void, blinds down, brain blown\n \u00a0 \u00a0glass-thin, electric impulses and bloated thoughts bolted in.\n \u00a0 \u00a0For this life being the only one my quiet mind knows,\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0its many versions and phases, I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t your daughter\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u2009\u2014\u2009or anyone\u2009\u2014\u2009when you were the blue-water navy,\n \u00a0 \u00a0or the beheaded, or the baby boy. Or was I?\n\nI\u2019m sorry I was not yet born and could not yet hear you\n \u00a0 \u00a0when you were over there, listening carefully\n \u00a0 \u00a0for the rain and small movements of animals, for sounds\n \u00a0 \u00a0of life, through a green, \ufb01ve-\ufb01ngered haze.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I consider sentiment, fact; authenticity, originality,\n \u00a0 \u00a0when they are irrelevant. So many choices\n \u00a0 \u00a0in supermarkets, the natural habitat of panic attacks, \n \u00a0 \u00a0it\u2019s enough to make anyone sorry and I am.\n\nI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s taking over half a century to link your purple-patched\n \u00a0 \u00a0brain scan to the basic biology of stress. The piano thunders on,\n \u00a0 \u00a0sustain pedal wired to the facial muscles of all your neglecters, \n \u00a0 \u00a0aching like hell behind their stamina and machinery.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I had, logically, to think of my own self \ufb01rst\u2009/\u2009simultaneously,\n \u00a0 \u00a0navigating through the \ufb01re and acid of Trust and her sycophant\n \u00a0 \u00a0Love before returning. All the powerful were women; the power\n \u00a0 \u00a0of penises and facial hair originated there, cajoled by matriarchs.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0As if skin and breath were insigni\ufb01cant!\nI\u2019m so sorry.\n \u00a0 \u00a0Where are you now, to take into my arms and resuscitate?\n \u00a0 \u00a0Is it too late, given you\u2019re \ufb01fty and no longer a child?\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s always mothers and mind control which is why\nI thank you for breaking the cycle, withstanding the enormity\n \u00a0 \u00a0of generations, magnetic as water,\n \u00a0 \u00a0to let us go. You weren\u2019t to know\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0about other outrageous families and sadistic counterparts.\n \u00a0 \u00a0A nugget of my limbic system remembered choosing my own\n \u00a0 \u00a0lemon-yellow baby clothes so thank you.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0I squeezed that into the thumb-sized space\n \u00a0 \u00a0in the palm of my hand knowing all along they were wrong\n \u00a0 \u00a0and imploding with it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I wept in the shower for your canceled wedding,\n \u00a0 \u00a0letting the violet dress down the plughole, unsure \n \u00a0 \u00a0what it all meant except things staying the same, future\n \u00a0 \u00a0aggravating my brain, a baby brother gone again.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you were out there, alone, de\ufb01ned by the worst\n \u00a0 \u00a0of others and de\ufb01ned by your children\u2019s prisms of hope\n \u00a0 \u00a0and survival mechanisms. In one version, you did marry and lived\n \u00a0 \u00a0in a house with green walls and extravagant furniture.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that consensus reality had you set \ufb01re to your bed\n \u00a0 \u00a0as you lay in it; arrested, put in a cell, let off the next day\n \u00a0 \u00a0because the lawyer believed it was a genuine attempt\n \u00a0 \u00a0and convinced the police.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to withstand such torrents\n \u00a0 \u00a0of \u200aknowledgeless advice and legal toxi\ufb01cation,\n \u00a0 \u00a0clinging to reality by a sinew of tooth, remembering yourself,\n \u00a0 \u00a0through the rough and the smooth.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I was absent, memorizing books of the Bible\n \u00a0 \u00a0for a bar of Dairy Milk, owning up to things\n \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019d never done, getting con\ufb01rmed as an antidote\n \u00a0 \u00a0to the evil core of me.\n\nI\u2019m sorry it was exotic to think of kids like me\n \u00a0 \u00a0ending up in prison, coincidentally, inevitably\n \u00a0 \u00a0or prevented (which is the same), salvaged, peristalsized\n \u00a0 \u00a0through society, brain safely contained,\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0doused daily in cold water or electricity\n \u00a0 \u00a0or disgrace, temptations kept consistently far enough away\n \u00a0 \u00a0as to appear illusory\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0like you, my brave mother, fantastic prodigy\n \u00a0 \u00a0in \ufb02owing white caftan, knotted long brown hair, a beautiful gaze\n \u00a0 \u00a0of solemnity, rare stone, emotionless (de\ufb01ned by others).\n\nI\u2019m sorry I was ill-prepared for your soiled mattress\n \u00a0 \u00a0and comatose body, under a wave of advocaat \n \u00a0 \u00a0and transistor radios oozing with cheap Scotch. Even I\n \u00a0 \u00a0developed feelings for them amidst adults acting like it\u2019s okay\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0to leave you this way, the blue bottle \ufb02ies in on it,\n \u00a0 \u00a0in\ufb02ated with dog shit and red hot egos, resting on your cheek,\n \u00a0 \u00a0your lip, too cunning to get rid of.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that laughing off a difficult childhood\n \u00a0 \u00a0didn\u2019t make it never happen. Even a basic calculator\n \u00a0 \u00a0recognizes an in\ufb01nite loop as a malfunction; don\u2019t they see cutting\n \u00a0 \u00a0off my privates every night needs additional information?\n\nI\u2019m sorry I talked you out of wounding yourself\n \u00a0 \u00a0although I know it feels hopeful and lets in sunlight and air\n \u00a0 \u00a0through an open door. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you go up.\n \u00a0 \u00a0I, also, don\u2019t know how.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I prioritize the stimulation of adrenalin and opioids\n \u00a0 \u00a0in my own axis before I come to you. Thank you\n \u00a0 \u00a0for believing I love you even though you know\n \u00a0 \u00a0I don\u2019t know love or trust it.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0I dreamed a baby died from kidney failure. The worst part?\n \u00a0 \u00a0Not knowing distress from relief in the face of the mother,\n \u00a0 \u00a0like a child in an experiment. What does this mean?\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0My man fearing a moment of madness. Not locking the\n \u00a0 \u00a0knives away but keeping a steady eye on them, paying attention\n \u00a0 \u00a0to the moon and turning moods. He underestimates me;\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019m my own doppelg\u00e4nger. Here I am, locked to him, discussing\n \u00a0 \u00a0sex positions and holiday destinations. Here I am \n \u00a0 \u00a0courting solitude in the doorway, a pair of eyes and a chest cavity\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0thrumming on the dark boundary between survival and self-control. \n \u00a0 \u00a0While there are no babies, I carry on. I am testament to the problem\n \u00a0 \u00a0of the baby. Look at me\u2009\u2014\u2009\ufb02aunting my own survival. Who am I?\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0Except the parasite that accidentally caught on\n \u00a0 \u00a0to your womb wall as you lay stoned on a fur-lined coat\n \u00a0 \u00a0in a hallway in Moss Side? Happy accident, accidentally on purpose. \n\n \u00a0 \u00a0Close the piano lid. Empty a drawer. Things happen.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for absences, holidaying in France, studying guilt,\n \u00a0 \u00a0time-traveling the pain barrier, intent on nerve endings\n \u00a0 \u00a0and their connections to various biological systems.\n \u00a0 \u00a0Learning to accept and relinquish responsibility appropriately.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0Throwing back the hot stone in a horizontal line.\n\nThank you to the policeman who took all the men whose safety\n \u00a0 \u00a0you feared for to the pub so you could come home\n \u00a0 \u00a0for dinner, monologue, nail varnish remover, a set\n \u00a0 \u00a0of impartial weighing scales and cheap French wine.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about the home, the wine, the monologue resonating\n \u00a0 \u00a0against the plastic mug others might keep for you, fussing \n \u00a0 \u00a0over makeup-smeared walls, upholstery and understatements. \n \u00a0 \u00a0I\u2019m a bit sad we can\u2019t see Al. He comes on the radio sometimes.\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not bringing you home, \ufb01nally, to thrive and repair.\n \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to stay, singing Luther Vandross on the walkway\n \u00a0 \u00a0outside at 6 a.m., fetching toast from the neighbor. I was hoping\n \u00a0 \u00a0for perfection, believing in anything, all those years.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0Is it too ambitious to hope? I\u2019m sentimentally sorry\n \u00a0 \u00a0despite a genuine fear of sentimentality and pseudo-unhappiness,\n \u00a0 \u00a0struggling under the weight of an A1 poster on complex trauma\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0and a pair of Sennheiser headphones to lock me in.\n \u00a0 \u00a0Think of what it is when God himself puts his arms around you\n \u00a0 \u00a0and says \u201cwelcome home.\u201d There\u2019s nothing mysterious\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0about my thoughts or affect, nor yours, nor anyone\u2019s, biologically\n \u00a0 \u00a0generated by the relationships we hide our consciousness from.\n \u00a0 \u00a0Oh unhappiness and in\ufb01delity! Disguised in metaphor\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0you\u2019re nothing but the deep yearning of an infant for its mother\n \u00a0 \u00a0and the furiousness. Making this connection is like remembering \n \u00a0 \u00a0being born, which is like folding time, which is no one to blame and \nall the world to blame.\n\nThank you for picking up the handless, footless doll\n \u00a0 \u00a0in the park, saving him from a dog or fox or thoughtless children,\n \u00a0 \u00a0keeping him to your breast on the tram, the bus, in pubs\n \u00a0 \u00a0and not noticing the scathing looks.\n\n \u00a0 \u00a0I learnt to trust without you, leaving my thoughts\n \u00a0 \u00a0outside for \ufb01ve minutes and trusting the neighbor\u2019s cat\n \u00a0 \u00a0not to urinate on them.\n\nI\u2019m sorry my stand-in mother was an evil replica, machine-like\n \u00a0 \u00a0yet unpredictable. We tried to calculate an algorithm for her\n \u00a0 \u00a0mood, as you would\u2019ve done, and in 14 years never cracked it.\n \u00a0 \u00a0She remained seated when I left for the last time.\n\nYou weren\u2019t to know\n \u00a0 \u00a0and they wouldn\u2019t have believed you anyway.\n \u00a0 \u00a0We learn to accept the clouds for what they are\nand wait, patiently.\n", "title": "Apology", "id": 58580, "author": "Ruby Robinson"}

Still later,\nFriends shouldered high mountains to the lee shore.\n\nGashed, and the gash a fountain of waters,\nThe landscape defames a single flower:\nAmaranth.

And yet He sees her,\nDefames her, considers His time well\nSpent imagining a continent of flowers\nWhose final climate is a broken girl.\n\nBells of a Cretan woman in labor\nHurled from a tower, flesh realer\nThan the ground she somehow upwards curled\nInto the bloom of her groin where bells\n\nAre bees. I am an old man with a new beard.\nI am the offspring of my child sprung from hell.\nShipwreck makes peninsular metaphor\nOut of my hatred, her rape, and one bell tower.\n\nConfusion suicides the poems, heaven I heard\nWhere the juice runs from stone-struck flowers.\nAt the end of the world I must use proper\nViolence. Nothing is more true to tell.\n\nTell the taut-strung higher calendars\nI\u2019ve a margent in mind and new words\nHope to say, catastrophe to hear, \nOld confederates and inwood apples\n\nWhere apples never shone. Also tell\nOf mountains shouldered underneath one flower\nCalled amaranth. They tired of the world\nWho made the world this way. God never\n\nDid, never will.

We don\u2019t know\nwho concocted this one, where the triggerfish\nand clowns fade to inky neon dashes under\na fisherman\u2019s skiff. A few plastic pontoons\nknock around makeshift slips. Dusk coaxes\nfrom the shore the small, dull chime\nof a spoon against a pot. And TV voices\nflash slow across a cliff where two pink lovers\nin matching swimwear kiss their glasses\nat the edge of a blue pool built just low enough\ninto the hill so the couple can gaze into the sea\nand think of infinity. Many, many years ago,\na great emperor wiggled his finger\nand commanded his army to corral all the lepers\nin his domain then pack them into a sailing ship\nto be delivered to the missions on this cluster\nof verdant volcanic rock. The emperor\u2019s orders\nto his captain were clear: if the monks refused\nthe ship\u2019s freight, the skipper was to simply\ndump the whole sick cargo far from any shore.\nOther incurables followed in lots over time,\nor trickled in, hiding from nearby tribes,\nor banished from other lands to live among these\nlush slopes of mahogany, papaya, and weeds.\nTwo women, Filomena and Josefa, arrived\nwithin days of one another. By then, each had lost\nmost their toes, though they had ten\nfull fingers between them, each woman\nwith one hand still intact. No one is sure\nhow it began, but once a week the pair\nwould knock on the door of the scowling\nMadre Clementina to borrow the hospital\u2019s\nonly guitar, carved from jackfruit and cracked\npretty bad along the back.

And they jammed. Filomena with the five \ndeft hammers of her left and Josefa with her right,\nthick-muscled\u2009\u2014\u2009both blue-veined and furious, \nscrubbing from the instrument all those wicked \nrhythms from Castile to Nowhere on a fragile \nscrap of furniture that could barely hold its tune. \nThey sat shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh, \ntheir good hands brushing from time to time. \nWhat they couldn\u2019t remember, they made up, \nand everything they made up disappeared \nover the lagoon and over the ocean, every note \nin every run, every lie and desire, every nick \nand crack in the jackfruit, the fat harmonics \nplucked from the old nun\u2019s grunts, six taut strands\nof gut whose chords skimmed the water \nlike night locusts in bursts of low clouds \nand which bore everything in front of them and behind,\nthe brine of the women\u2019s necks mixed with the salt\nof the lagoon, the cliffs, the spoons, the bright \nnimbus of the West dipping like a noose, \nthe future of pontoons and fake tits, the history\nof nifty crowns pried loose of their jewels, \nthe jiggle of a little finger gone still. \n\nOne way to erase an island is to invent the waters\nthat surround it.

{"poem": "I need more time, a simple day in Paris hotels and window shopping.\nThe croissants will not bake themselves and the Tower of London would\nLike to spend a night in the tropics with gray sassy paint. It has many\nWounds and historic serial dreams under contract to Hollywood.\nWho will play the head of Mary, Queen of Scots, and who will braid her\n\nHair? Was it she who left her lips on the block for the executioner,\nWhose hands would never find ablution, who would never touch a woman\nAgain or eat the flesh of a red animal? Blood pudding would repulse him\nUntil joining Anne. That is the way of history written for Marlow and\nShakespear. They are with us now that we are sober and wiser,\n\nNot taking the horrors of poetry too seriously. Why am I telling you this\nNonsense, when I have never seen you sip your coffee or tea,\nIn the morning? Not to mention,\nNever heard you sing, although some claim it is quite grand.\nWill you teach me to sing like Chaliapin? Will I impress you with my\n\nCartoon Russian accent? I like sour cream and borsht;\nWe went to school together.

I have other stories too strange and beautiful to be\nTold. They have no sound or memory. They will rest on your lips when\nYou bring your hands to your mouth to stop their gush of air against your\nFace. We should go back and meet again at the street fair of cufflinks.\nOur hearts teach us how to fly with wings of pain.\n\nThat is the price of the disarticulated lessons we should not abstain from\nPlaying. The accumulated misdemeanors add up to the most egregious\nFelony: ignoring the demands of the heart. We remain in abeyance to\nThe muses who are only interested in their outcomes,\nWe are just the worms on their hooks of selfishness.\n\nWhat do they care, we are not Greek. We are just a dream of pleasant\nComic arias that suffice as whims in the morning.\nWe are small enemies to them with strange large hearts that control the\nWeather in the heavens. They cannot change or unteach us not to\nTrespass their quarters of endowment. Perhaps, after all, you are an\n\nAffable spirit bubbling over with your own deductions to minimize the\nPointed dots in your beautiful endeavors.\nAlthough I feel like a bird with a broken wing,\nEach day I think of you I fumble an attempt to fly to impress you with\nThe color of my paper wings.\n", "title": "Felonies and Arias of the Heart", "id": 58496, "author": "Frank Lima"}

{"poem": "We went to all those places where they restore sadness and joy\nand call it art. We were piloted by Auden who became\nUnbearably acrimonious when we dropped off Senghor into the\nsteamy skies of his beloved West Africa. The termites and ants\nwere waiting for him to unearth the sun in Elissa. The clouds\nwere as cool as a dog\u2019s nose pressed against our cheeks. I\nnotice your eggshell skin is as creamy as a lion\u2019s armpit as we\ncross the horizon on strands of Yeats\u2019 silver hair. There is a\nlight coffee flame in his eyes guiding us like an old Irish house\ncleaner holding a candle in a black and white English movie.\nYeats\u2019 lips look like an angry Rimbaud illuminating poetry with\nhis youth and vigorous sunlight. He knew eternity would vanish\nthe sun at dusk. He caught it with a rainbow tied to his finger.\nThere was nothing left after that. We cross the equator\nheading north following Emily Dickinson\u2019s black bag containing\nstems of her longer poems preserved in darkness and memory\nlike wild pearls thrown overboard to avoid capture by Spanish\npirates. The islands below float by like water hearts in a child\u2019s\naquarium. We are candy wrappers being blown across the\nwaxed floors of poetry. We land on the Brooklyn Bridge.\nWhitman\u2019s past-port face is grinning at the nineteenth century\nin the thorny arms of Gerard Manley Hopkins whose head was\nset on fire by God\u2019s little hands. The hands that circumcised\nthe world. Gertrude Stein is a match flaring on a young\nwoman\u2019s pillow whose birthmarks have been stolen. We cross\nthe green Atlantic into World War One. We are met by Rilke\ndressed in his Orpheus uniform wearing white sonnet gloves\nthat once belonged to a stone angel. Rilke offers us a glass of\namontillado made from Lorca\u2019s private stock of gypsy tears.\nThe sherry is not quite as dry as Wallace Stevens\u2019 lush mango\nmetaphors of familiar objects. Although Stevens\u2019 poems are\nfragrant, there is a lingering afterthought of Pound on the\ntongue. Pound collected his misty feelings to make raindrops\ninto European and American poetry. Vagueness became as\nsharp as a pencil. Our blue box is not allowed to attend\nApollinaire\u2019s birthday party held by the august Acad\u00e9mie\nfran\u00e7aise on the Eiffel Tower. He is being awarded the \u201cGolden\nFrog Souffle Award\u201d and a one-way ticket to the Greek and\nRoman past to spend afternoons with Williams filling wheel-\nbarrows with the twentieth century. Both Apollinaire and\nWilliams could hail a cab on Madison Avenue in any country.\nAfter the bash we toured Paris and London with D.H. Lawrence\nwho kept stopping to relieve himself of the great mysteries of\nlife whenever we went by a Bavarian gentian plant. He claimed\nhe was writing poetry for his new book: Acts of Attention for\nLove Poems. Eliot was rebuilding London when we left. It\nreminded him of Detroit or Cincinnati or Saint Louis. He was\nremoving despair from the weather. He thought it affected\npeople\u2019s minds and did not want to overload Mayakovsky\u2019s\nemptiness with old English churches that pray for water heaters\nand cloudless nights. Mayakovsky, on the other hand, insisted\nthere were bugs in Russia who could write poetry just as\ninterestingly as Eliot. The Russian winter is elegant cruelty\ncompared with the English milk-toast weather: \u201cA man without\na cloud in his trousers is not a man.\u201d Eliot thought this was the\nmost boring statement he had ever heard. Although\nCummings\u2019 poems appear unintentional on the surface, he did\nnot act like a drunken amputee at the dinner table and always\nsaid pleasant things that came out of nowhere. His\nconversation was experimental but logical and he investigated\nwords, mixing them on paper with a pencil. Cummings was all\netcetera after a few drinks. We move the sun to South\nAmerica. Neruda had become an organic poet writing about\nthe fulcra of yes and no. He wasn\u2019t home when we got there,\nso we went over to Allen\u2019s for some microbiotic poetry. As\nusual, Allen was rolling incense and howling at America. Allen\nwas always mystical and beautiful when he walked on the\nLower East Side. When he stepped into the old Jewish\npavement, he mystified the habitu\u00e9s. David Shapiro, the Djinn\nof subatomic poetry, asked Allen what was the future of poetry\nin the borough of Queens? Allen placed the palm of his right\nhand on David\u2019s glistening forehead and said: \u201cDavid, don\u2019t you\nknow? The future has no future. It is very old and doesn\u2019t\nworry about its future anymore, because it has so little left of\nit.\u201d Allen made suicide exhilarating when he wrote Kaddish.\nFinally, suicide could talk about the pain of living with\nunbearable beauty. Beauty was Frank O\u2019Hara talking to Second\nAvenue with a diamond in his head. We were the personal\ndetails in Frank\u2019s harem of private lives when LeRoi insisted on\nbecoming black, abandoning us for a noble cause, according to\nFrank, who loved Imamu Amiri Baraka. We were the details in\nFrank\u2019s poems and living one\u2019s life was a detail in Frank\u2019s life.\nJohn Ashbery arrived from Paris on a plane made of expensive\nsuits, shirts, and ties. Like his poems, he was sparkling and\nsqueaky clean, dressed in elegant language. He is the\ndaydream that had become a poet. His subject is to have no\nsubject. Perhaps a casual reference to someone special. He is\na poet of the less obvious in life: the sestina made of clouds.\nWe crossed the equator on our way to a cocktail party for Gary\nSnyder. There is no other life for his outdoor poems,\nhitchhiking on hands-on love. Gary seems to have time to\nwrite poems about the notes in his life. Kenneth, on the other\nhand, has a paper cup full of wonderful poems. He can write a\npoem about a cathedral living in a paper cup. Kenneth travels\neverywhere with his paper cup. At a certain time of day,\nKenneth finds room in his paper cup for perfect days and\nperfect moments:\nPerfect moments when Frank spoke to us.\nPerfect moments when Allen spoke to us.\nAnd they sang to us\nwith human wings\nupon which we sleep.\n", "title": "Incidents of Travel in Poetry", "id": 58491, "author": "Frank Lima"}

So much mask.\nI grabbed Charlotte's hand and held it for a while when things felt\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dicey.\nIt felt dicey as they cornered us from two sides and we went down the\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0tight side street, up the hill. Charlotte's hand.\nIt's like that.\nMoving from isolation to the depths of friends.\n\n\nAt first we didn't mask up. We were poets.\nThen slowly one by one we did.\nAs we got turnt.\nAs I got turnt I mean.\nSometimes I still don't mask up. It often feels hubristic.\nI keep a bandana in my pocket.\nIt isn't super effective. It falls down a lot.\nLast night, I tied it around my neck as we walked up the side street hill.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I pulled it over my face as I walked past the line of cops. I noticed\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Emma there, throwing eggs. I ducked. Two balloons filled with\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 paint flew by. Visors suddenly yellow.\n\n\nShe said to me, how is your heart?\nAnd I at first worried her question.\nThen I realized she meant my heart and how it was turnt.\nIt is good, I said, I am opening it; I am expanding it.\nAnd I meant it.\nI love you I texted Felix.\nLub u!!!!!! I texted Haruto.\nTexting Isabella and Jackson, I love you guys.\nI miss you.\nI texted love you some forty-three times in the last few years.\nI texted <3 some thirty-three times.\nLub u, eighteen times.\nMiss you, thirty-eight.\n\n\nShe said your feed is all riots, plants, picnics, and poets.\nIt was an accusation.\nShe was noticing that I had got turnt.\nAnd I said, my son, my son is in my feed too.\nI didn't bother to argue the riot with her.\n\n\nStill, oh that moment.\nTurnt moment:\n\n\nI was at the poetry reading and Mia didn't go. She was supposed to\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0read too but she didn't. She said she wanted to see what happens.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then she texts I love you and I know then that Trader Joe's has\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0been looted. All the wines out in the street.\nSuch sweet elixir, FOMO.\nThen the rest of that night.\nWe quickly say good-byes after the reading, refuse the offer of going to\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 drinks, careen from the reading to our home. One of us on twit-\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ter the entire time. Texting too. While we are driving, one of us at\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 home runs out into the streets, towards the gas. I drive up and two\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of us get out of the car and I stay in the car and drive the few blocks\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 home. My son has fallen asleep in the back. I am coughing in the\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 car from the gas. He sleeps through it. I take him out and carry him\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 up to bed. More texts. I love you, I text. Come by and get me when\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 you are done.\n\n\nLater that night, I go out again. Miguel stays home with Minjoon. I go\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 to a fight party; Marxist v. Nihilist. No one knows which is which.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mohamed, my fighting teacher, fights. I miss it. I love you I text.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 She texts back I'm high on being slugged; my eyes are swollen; I\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lost; I'm turnt.\nStanding outside, a woman gets kicked out of the club. The bouncer\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 tosses her out and into us. She is fucked up. And this feels awful to\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 her. Her arms wildly swinging indicate this awful feeling. It feels\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 awful to us. Another woman tries to help her and she slugs her. She\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 misses and the woman who she has tried to slug takes her, calms\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 her down. I hear her saying I love you, I love you over and over.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Later I will learn that she spent the entire night talking the woman\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 down. It's like that. When turnt, sometimes one needs to be held.\nStill later, I stand on the street, outside my house and watch the\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 t-mobile get looted. A man tries to stop another man who has\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 his hammer at the ready in front of the window. The man who is\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 attempting to stop the hammer gets hit in the face with the butt\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of the hammer. I decide to go to bed. It is 3 am. I text Nathan and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 say I love you and I'll leave the key in the box for you. The march\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 continues on, Nathan continues on, turns left a block away and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 then when Nathan texts me back I know the Whole Foods is looted\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and they are all drinking champagne, dancing. All of them will get\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 a cold later.\nRiot champagne becomes a term among us that winter.\nI wasn't there but I was there too. My germs were there.\nI too had that cold.\n\n\nIs this poem too heroic?\nI am sorry.\nI worry it is.\nOr I know it is.\nWe are turnt to mere vandals at moments. I'll admit it.\nEvery computer in that shop.\nEvery phone in that one.\nEvery car in that car lot.\n\n\nI don't want it to be heroic but last night I turned the corner and Nor\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 was there with her bike and when I saw her I said I love you and\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 we walked down the street as each window was cracked. They got\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 turnt. Eventually we disperse. I jog for a few minutes away and out\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 of the kettle. We joke, circle back to watch a car burn. Oliver walks\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by. He is hurrying towards the dispersal. I love you we say to him as\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 he heads off. The car burns. The fire truck arrives. As I stand there\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 watching it, it is as if everyone I ever texted I love you to walks\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by. I love you we call out to each other.\nA group of women walk by the car and stop to take photographs. So\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 much joy they have. They are laughing with such triumph. Selfies\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and all. Turnt.\n\n\nThis poem is true. I have texted I love you and its variations over\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and over.\nSometimes I barely knew you.\nBut the names are not true.\nThis is not a coterie poem.\nIs it a milieu poem?\nCan it be a movement poem?\nI took all the names of this poem and never wrote them in.\nThere is no electronic record of them.\nI found a list of the most popular baby names for various countries in\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2015, the year in which I am writing this poem. I made a list, one\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 male and one female from each list. Then I alphabetized it. And I\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 put those names in this poem one by one. I got to O.\nBut Olivia, Saanvi, Santiago, Seoyeon, Sofia, Yui, and Zeynep, I love\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 you too.\n\n\n", "title": "Turnt", "id": 58500, "author": "Juliana Spahr"}

{"poem": "It is dynamic positioning that\nAllows a semi-submersible the\n\nAbility to hover there over\nThe well. It is a thirty-six inch tube,\n\nA casing, that extends down to allow\nThe drill and bit to be rotated there;\n\nThe drill then spudding in; the seafloor, dark,\nAnd giving way. It is a thick column\n\nOf drilling mud that keeps natural gas\nAnd oil beneath the seafloor while the well\n\nIs capped and it is a cement that\nFills in the casing so the drill pipe stays\n\nUnmoving, stable, in this ever moving sea.\nIt is a sort of drilling mud that is\n\nThen pumped through the drill pipe and out through\nThe drill bit then up through the casing and\n\nThen back up to the oil rig in the space\nBetween the drill pipe and the inner wall.\n\nIt is a blowout preventer, a series of valves\nThat seal off the excessive pressure should\n\nThe wellhead kick then blowout. There are all\nThese variables. Various valves. Pressures.\n\nBuoyancies. Mixes of cements. Currents. Claims.\nHumans. Bow spring. Top plug. Shoe track. Floatshoe.\n\nI could go on and on here calling the\nNew muses of innovation, common\n\nVocabulary, that covers over the\nElaborate simplicity of this,\n\nThis well, Macondo well, was drilled by\nDeepwater Horizon and it went through\n\nFive thousand feet, through the abyssal zones,\nThe epipelagic with its sunlight\n\nThe mesopelagic with its twilight\nThe bathypelagic with its midnight\n\nThen where the sea meets floor, the deep ocean,\nA blowout preventer there with the fish,\n\nThe darker fish, the large detritevars\nThat feed on the drizzle of the moulted\n\nExoskeletons, the carnivores, snipe eels\nBig lantern fish, and zooplankton, corals.\n\nThis well then went on reaching for the oil\nAnother thirteen thousand feet. When it hits\n\nThe pay zone, down through it, down deeper, deep.\nThis well, Macondo well, was exploratory.\n\nThis story then begins with other wells,\nBut I will tell the story of This Well:\n\nIn April twenty ten, the setting south\nAnd east of Louisiana's long coast.\n\nIt begins with a round of tests, some done\nAnd some avoided. An environmental\n\nImpact and blowout plan declared to be\nNot necessary. Drilling easy. Then\n\nOn April twenty, bled off five barrels\nOf fluid, reduced drill pressure. No flow.\n\nAt noon, a drill pipe goes in hole so as\nTo begin mud displacement. Seawater\n\nThen pumped in to displace mud. Kill line\nNot bled. It goes on like this. Partial lab\n\nResults, a circulation pressure that\nDid not yet match the modeling results\n\nAnd yet cement job pumped. Fluid returns\nObserved. Bottom plug ruptured. Still the\n\nCement is pumped so it bumps top wiper plug\nAt twelve thirty. Then two pressure tests.\n\nThe drill pipe run in hole to eight thousand\nAnd three hundred and sixty seven feet.\n\nSo mud displacement starts, the seawater\nIs pumped, then the spacer, then the fresh\n\nWater. The kill line opened and pressure then\nDecreased. Drill pipe pressure increased.\n\nThe kill line shut in. Mud offloading done.\nIt goes on. Drill pipe pressure. Kill line open.\n\nThen drill pipe pressure high again. Then sea-\nWater is pumped. Kill line full. Kill line\n\nOpened, bled to mini trip tank. Flow\nIs stopped. Kill line monitored. It\n\nIs then open. No flow. Considered\nA good test. Blowout preventer open-\n\nEd, seawater then pumped down the drill\nPipe to displace the mud and spacer from\n\nThe riser. It is nine o'clock. The flow\nOut from the well increased. Trip tank then\n\nEmptied. Then fluids discharged overboard. Pumps\nRestarted. Drill pipe pressure on constant\n\nIncrease. It goes on like this. Pump number\nTwo started. Pressure spike. Then pumps two, three,\n\nAnd four are shut down. Pump one still online.\nThen pumps three, four restarted. Pressure build-\n\nIng, pump two. Pumps shut down. First pump three, four,\u00a0\nThen one. Then drill pipe pressure fluctuates.\n\nIncreases. Then decreases. Then again\nIncreases. Then held briefly, then again\n\nDecreases. A repair begins. At some\nMoment hydrocarbons enter the bot-\n\nTom of the well undetected and rise\nInside the wellbore, growing quickly as\n\nThey meet the lower pressure of the sur-\nFace, heavy drill mud, other fluids, sea-\n\nWater, all pushed by the rising and\nExpanding gases followed by more,\n\nBy high pressure oil, gases, other flu-\nIds, all there rising, swelling in\n\nThe wellbore, all there, pushing from the\nReservoir. It is almost at ten\n\nO'clock when mud begins its overflow-\nIng of the line and then on the rig floor.\n\nIt is almost at ten o'clock when mud\nThen shoots up through the derrick. It is almost\n\nAt ten o'clock, diverter shut so that\nThe gas and drilling fluid could be routed\n\nTo the baffle plates, the poorboy degass-\nEr, then the lower annual prev-\n\nEnter is activated. The drill press-\nUre, the volumes of gases, fluids, drill-\n\nIng mud, seawater, then is steadily in-\nCreasing. And it begins again. Or be-\n\nGins some more. First as mud. A mud that roar-\nIng, rained. Then the gas as it discharge-\n\nIng, hissing, the poorboy degasser fill-\nIng. Next the first gas alarm then the oth-\n\nErs. It was then almost close to ten o'\nClock, still when next a roaring noise, a vib-\n\nRation, engines began rapid increase-\nIng as also the drill pipe pressure rap-\n\nIdly increasing as the rig then los-\nIng power, shut down processes then fail-\n\nIng. First explosion on five seconds aft-\nEr. Then explosion again, ten sec-\n\nOnds later. It was not yet ten\nO'clock when the mayday call was first made.\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon gutted stem\nTo stern. What happens next ends with eleven\n\nDead. The rig tethered still to the deepwell.\nThe shrapnel. The lightbulbs then popping. The\n\nHeat. Hot fireballs. The lifeboats smoke filled ovens.\nSome lifeboats left, not yet full. Those left\n\nBehind then jumped in to oil-covered,\nStill water and so swam away. Some died:\n\nJason Anderson. Bubba Burkeen. Shane\nM. Roshto. Donald Clark. Wyatt Kemp. Karl\n\nDale Kleppinger. Gordon Lewis Jones. Keith\nBlair Manuel. Dewey Revette. Adam\n\nWeise. Stephen Ray Curtis. I will not tell\nYou their lives, their loves, their young children, their\n\nRelationship to oil. Our oil. The well\nExploded. They then died. Some swam away.\n\nSome floated away in boats. Donald Vidrine,\nCurt Kuchta, Jimmy Wayne Harrell. I did\n\nNot die. I watched it then burn on a\nFlat screen.

{"poem": "This is the light of the mind, cold and planetary.\nThe trees of the mind are black. Their irregular branches,\nlike broken arms backlit from MRI dye, offset by yearning.\nThey take form in ways only experts can decipher.\nThe light is blue. The observation of the alien doctor\nflickers in his iris, furnace gaslight burning like a pagan memorial.\n\nThe grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if I were God,\nI pity their need for idolatry. It bares itself only to the void of me,\nPrickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility.\nI am unable to convince them otherwise.\nI hear them mew and compete as if for a rough teat's clear nutrition.\nFoolish rule of the organic, uncultured and out of control.\nI am mum and tidy as a nun in comparison.\nThough capable of devastation are my desires which punish\nthe landscape with recrimination, uprooting the hedges.\nThey swallow fire, speak in four languages, and love no one.\nI shudder with pride as they push themselves back to their origin,\nto the scraped-out bottom of a uterine nothing;\nthis hard loneliness, skull-solid, pushed back into vagueness\nuntil it succumbs as if overwhelmed by barbiturates.\u00a0\n\nFumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place\nSeparated from my house by a row of headstones.\nIts green vapors trigger an olfactory d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu like a recurrent nightmare.\nI envy the buried faces finally freed from worry and ailment,\nfrom the pressure to remain always forward-thinking.\nI picture their release, the prostrate bodies floating up as if levitated.\nWhat peace, what stillness was shoveled onto their pine box beds\nwhere darkness then dropped, all at once, final as an execution.\nI simply cannot see where there is to get to.\n\nThe moon is no door. It is a face in its own right,\nWhite as a knuckle and terribly upset. I identify with its nausea.\nIt meets me in the mirror uninvited, this face beneath my face,\nrestless and unwilling. It formulates inside me like a kicking fetus\nand refuses to be ignored. It haunts and threatens like a past trauma.\nIt drags the sea after it like a dark crime; mute as a mug shot,\nit is quiet, like someone suffocated who suddenly stops struggling.\nI recognize in its warm death the expression of the starving\nWith the O-gape of complete despair. I live here.\n\nAgainst me a force, not stronger or more intelligent,\nbut more adaptable to poor weather like dandelions.\nI can feel it whittle me down to horse feed pellets.\nI'm being winnowed out of the earth's circulation,\nwith a pairing incremental as this winter's passing.\nTwice on Sunday the bells startle the sky\u2014\nEight great tongues affirming the Resurrection.\nI'm forced to listen to the liturgical lecturing,\ntruant student of a catechism I loathe.\nAt the end, they soberly bong out their names;\nMyths and ideals I could never bring myself to believe in,\nmy prayers, the self-flagellation of unrequited love.\n\nThe yew tree points up like a New England steeple.\nIt has a Gothic shape. It used to remind me of home.\nThe eyes lift after it and find the moon.\nOnce fragile as rice paper, it hangs static and tough\nlike a noose signifying more hardship ahead\u2014\ninterrogating flashlight that hurts my eyes.\nNow no home exists\u2014just an empty bed,\na pile of mangled sheets atop a dark wood floor,\nlike snow atop the frozen mud tracks of hoof and wheel.\n\nThe moon is my mother.

I lie at the bottom, smashed\nlike a dinner plate against kitchen tile, china chips and jagged bits.\nI lie at the bottom, shattered and dangerous, looking up\nwith a baby's stunned engrossment. I'm moving closer to Pluto and Mars.\nClouds are flowering blue and mystical over the face of the stars,\u2014\nIt will not be quick. Death drinks me in, slow as syrup.\n\nInside the church, the saints will be all blue.\nThey've ascended into heaven's oxygen-deprived morgue.\nFloating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,\nTheir hands and faces stiff with holiness,\nmannequins perennially enacting the nativity in a wax museum.\nThe moon sees nothing of this. She is bald and wild\nas one dying of cancer. She begs for relief, but her pillow-muffled\nshrieks disperse with the other sounds and shadows of the night.\nWe are left alone, her cadaver face, gaunt and grim, prescient of mine.\nAnd the message of the yew tree is blackness\u2014blackness and silence.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sylvia Plath, \"The Moon and the Yew Tree,\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ariel (New York: Harper & Row, 1961)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "The Moon and the Yew Tree", "id": 58441, "author": "Tory Dent"}

{"poem": "The Brent geese fly in long low wavering lines on their migrations.\nThey start in western Europe, fatten in Iceland, then fly over the\nGreenland ice cap to Canada. They sometimes breed on the Arctic\ncoasts of central and western Siberia and winter in western Europe,\nsome in England, the rest in Germany and France. What I have to\noffer here is nothing revolutionary. They learn the map from their\nparents, or through culture rather than through genetics. It is just an\nobservation, a small observation that sometimes art can hold the oil\nwars and all that they mean and might yet mean within. Just as\nsometimes there are seven stanzas in a song. And just as sometimes\nthere is a refrain between each stanza. And just as often this sort of\nsong tells a certain sort of story, one about having something and then\nlosing it. Just as sometimes the refrain of a song is just one word said\nfour times. Just as sometimes the word is huge, sometimes coming\nfrom a machine and yet hitting in the heart; uplifting and ironic and\nbig enough to hold all these things in its four syllables. Just as some-\ntimes, often even, it contradicts, and thus works with, the stanzas. Just\nas the police clear out yet another public space and yet another camera\nfollows along behind. Just as the stream has no narration, only ambient\nnoise. And the police move slowly, methodically in a line as if they are\na many-legged machine. They know what they are doing. It is their\nthird time clearing the park and they will clear it many more times and\nthen they will win and a building will be built where there once was\nthe park. In this song, as is true of many songs, it is unclear why the\nsinger has lost something, maybe someone. In this time, the time of\nthe oil wars, there are many reasons that singers give for being so lost.\nOften they are lost because of love. Sometimes they are lost because of\ndrugs. Sometimes they have lost their country and in their heart it feels\nas if they have lost something big. And then sometimes they are lost\njust because they are in Bakersfield. Really though they are lost\nbecause in this time song holds loss. And this time is a time of loss.\nThe police know, as they move through the park yet one more time,\nthat they will win and a building will be built on the space. But right\nnow, the building is not there. All that is there are the police and\ndebris and the police deal with the debris. They push over book-\nshelves, open up boxes and look inside, tear into tents, awkwardly, the\npoles springing. They are only there to see if any humans remain.\nTomorrow the bulldozers will push the debris into big piles and load it\ninto trucks. The police wear white helmets and short sleeves under\ntheir kevlar vests. For many years the Brent geese ate eelgrass, but once\nthe eelgrass was gone to the wasting disease and the estuaries filled,\nthey moved inland to agricultural lands and began eating grasses and\nwinter-sown cereals. The Brent geese are social, adaptable. They fly\naround together, learning from each other, even as these groups are\noften unstable, changing from season to season. Songs in their most\npopular versions tend to be epiphanic, gorgeous with swelling chord\nchanges, full of lament too. And this song, like many, expresses the\ndesire to be near someone who is now lost. It travels as something\nlayered, infiltrated, unconfused with its refusals to make a simple\nsense. I want to give you this song sung in a bar in Oakland one night\nduring the ongoing oil wars. The singer had clearly been lost once, but\nthey sang as someone who eventually got in the car and drove out of\nBakersfield, perhaps early in the morning, the sun just starting to rise,\nor perhaps later after sun-up, the light washing out everything in\nBakersfield as the sun is wont to do there. Eventually they arrived to\nsing this song. This might have taken them many years. There was\nnothing that implied that the lostness was recent. But the lostness, it\nwas clear, was huge and had been experienced fully by them. It\nprobably doesn't matter where the sun was that day in Bakersfield\nwhen they got in the car. It probably just matters that there is a sun,\nstill, and they got in the car and drove, drove through the oil fields with\ntheir wells pumping out amber colored oils and their refineries with\ntall towers that heat the oil so as to sort its various viscosities, and drove\nthrough the black cloud that is the slow constant burn of the oil wars.\nThen at some point they were in Oakland. The oil near Bakersfield is\nheavy but it often benchmarks against the Brent blend. Brent blend is\na light crude oil, though not as light as West Texas Intermediate. It\ncontains approximately 0.37% of sulphur, classifying it as sweet crude,\nyet not as sweet as West Texas Intermediate. When the park is cleared\nand the building is built, it will headquarter an oil company. When\nthis oil company named their oil fields off the coast of Scotland, they\nchoose the names of water birds in alphabetical order: Auk, Brent,\nCormorant, Dunlin, Eider, Fulmar, and so on. Brent is also an\nacronym for the Jurassic Brent formation that makes up the Brent\noilfield, for Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Ness, and Tarbert. About two\nthirds of oil is benchmarked against what is called the Brent Crude Oil\nSpot price. Petroleum suppliers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East\noften price their oil according to Brent Crude's value on the Interconti-\nnential Exchange if it is being sold to the West. The Brent Crude Oil\nSpot price is set in dollars, maintained by force, endlessly manipulated\nby commodity futures markets. The refrain is the moment when the\nsinger makes it clear that they understand something about what is\nbeing lost. It was obvious they had lost their country, it being taken\nover by bankers and all. They had clearly been rejected. Loved too\nmuch and gotten too little of it back in return, many times. But none\nof this matters, it was obvious, in comparison to what is now being lost\nfor that night even though the song is about a minor loss, about the loss\nof tongue on clit or cock, the singer seemed to understand s0mething\nabout the other things that are lost. While a formation of police clear\nthe far side of the park of the debris of its occupation, another forma-\ntion of police on the other side shoot the new gasses, the ones we do\nnot yet know by name, into another part of the park where people are\nnow clustered. This camera \u00a0has sound and every few seconds there is a\npop. It is unevenly steady. The song is just about two people who are\nnot near each other, who have probably chosen not to be near each\nother any more. The song reflects and refracts the oil in ways both\nrelevant and trivial in how it tells about what happens when one lets\nlove go, when one gives up the tongue. It might be that only through\nthe minor we can feel enormity. It might be that there is nothing to\u00a0\nepiphany if it does not hint at the moment of sweaty relation larger\nthan the intimate. For what is epiphanic song if it doesn't spill out and\nover the many that are pulled from intimacies by oil's circulations?\nThe truckers, the sailors and deckhands, the assembly line workers,\nthose who maintain the pipelines, those who drive support in the\ncaravans that escort the tankers, the fertilizers, the thousands of\ninterlocking plastic parts, the workers who move two hundred miles\nand live in a dorm near a factory, alone, those on the ships who spend\nfifty weeks circulating with the oil unable to talk to each other because\nof no shared language and so are left only with two weeks in each year\nwhere they can experience the tongue in meaningful conversation. A\nlife that is only circulations. Before the police come, before the\nbuilding, in the middle of one night, a group of people form a line\nleading to the entrance of the park. Or several groups form several\nlines, all leading to the entrance. Some wear medical masks. Some\nwear glasses too. All pass bricks, one by one, down the line so as to\nmake a pile. They are silent for the most part, silent enough that it is\npossible to hear the bricks make a clink as they fall. The pile gets \nbigger and bigger. It is waist high. Then chest high. Some get out of\nthe line and climb on the pile, hold both their hands in the air because\nthey know now is the transitory, momentary triumph and it should be\nfelt. Others continue passing brick after brick, from one hand to\u00a0\nanother hand, arms extended, torsos at moments also going back and\nforth with the bricks. When they run out of bricks, the pile is topped\nwith fencing. Then they gather behind it, waiting. Back there, some-\none might possibly be singing to a child, singing the epiphanic song\nthat alludes to losing the moment of tongue on clit or cock over and\nover because the child cannot be comforted, because the singer knows\nonly loss. The room will be dark. The light will be on in the hall.\nThere will be shadows, in other words. And the singer will know about\nthese shadows at this moment and know they had agreed to be with\nshadows when they had the child. They had gambled in a sense on a\nquestion of sustaining. They had agreed to exist from now on with a\u00a0\nshadow. A shadow of love and a shadow of the burning of the oil fields that\nhas already happened and is yet to come and yet must come and a million\nother shadows that might possibly disappear in the light at that moment.\n\n\n\n", "title": "Transitory, Momentary", "id": 58455, "author": "Juliana Spahr"}

The basket he brings is full of sweet scones\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and I eat even the crumbs.

He offers tea and cold cakes. The tea is delicious:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 spiced like the start of our courtship, honeyed and warm.\n\nI drink every bit of the tea and put aside the rest.\n\nMy lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0like a man loving his strength. The lock I replaced\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0this morning will not keep him away.\n\nMy lover, who lives far away, opens the door to my room\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and brings me nothing.\n\nPerhaps he has noticed how fat I've grown, indulged.\n\nPerhaps he is poor and sick of emptying his store.\n\nIt is no matter to me any longer, he has filled me, already, so full.\n\nMy lover who is far away opens the door to my room\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and tells me he is tired.\n\nI do not ask what he's tired from for my lover, far away,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 has already disappeared.\n\nThe blankets are big with his body.

When I looked back \nher eyes had found the window: tree, students, \nbirds swimming by, mute in their element.\n\nIt was painful to hear the papery rasp \nof her folding and unfolding hands, to watch \ncolor smudging her neck and temple, branching \nto mist the delicate rim of one ear. I listened \nto the air sunder between us, the feverish hush \ncollapse. I could hear her breath\u2014smoke\n\nrising from ice. I could see what it cost her \nto make that leap. What heat it takes \nfor the body to blossom into speech.\n\n\n\n", "title": "The Student", "id": 58277, "author": "Dorianne Laux"}

Then,\nBack into the caprice case to dream\nIn a circle, a pony goes round.\nThe circle's association: There's a center\nTo almost everything but never\nAny certainty. Nothing is\nMore malleable than a moment. We were\nOnly yesterday breathing in a sea.\nSome summer sun\nAsked us over and over we went. The sand was hot.\nWe were only yesterday tender hearted\nWaiting. To be something.\nA spring. And then someone says, Sit down,\nWe have a heart for you to forget. A mind to suffer\nWith.

Then lay and studied stalks and blades.\nThen thought to pass the time by picking simples\nfor a posy that might sweeten our farewell;\nbut, bending to my task, disturbed a woodlark\u2019s nest.\n\nThe buzz and fluster of a woodlark\u2019s flight\u2009\u2014\u2009\nscissor and stitch at once!

I looked out\nover meadows yet to be laid up for mowing,\nponds and cherry orchards. Hedgerows lined\nthe road I meant to climb next day. \nHow paltry my equivocations seemed,\nand how unmanly, how unmannerly,\nto stay and parcel out over-subtle reasons,\nsuch that I could not ask her to allow,\nmuch less approve ... Better to leave at once. \nI met with him at dawn. We headed east.\n\nThey say there is a bird, the osprey, the fish hawk,\nso majestic it can mesmerise\nits prey, subduing it without a touch:\na fair example of authority.\nBut whether, as the book says, the firmament\n\u201csheweth the handiwork of the Creator\u201d\n(who \u201csets a tabernacle for the sun\u201d\nwhich is a \u201cstrong man coming from his chamber,\nfriend to the bridegroom,\u201d yes?) was all one to him.\nNot that he had a narrow nature, not\nthat he made a painful study of his life;\nbut I marvel that his mind could entertain \nnothing but proven truths that, being few,\nhuddled together like beasts in a storm.\n\nYet he was merciful, and stood upon these points: \nthat we should not accuse another soul\nnor force confession from the examinate\nby violence. Our methods must be nice.\nSometimes to keep them waking was enough\u2009\u2014\u2009\nif they would sit or offer to couch down\nwe would desire them to walk about\u2009\u2014\u2009\nand the swimming test was only used \nat such time of the year as when none took \na harm by it.

In brief\nshe was affected by a strange disease:\nand now, before I well know what is happening,\nshe has untied a ribbon, pulled down her blouse,\nand shown herself\u2009\u2014\u2009her pale skin lapped by candlelight, \nbutter-gold, flawless; except her breasts were dappled \nhere and there with gray-green blemishes\u2009\u2014\u2009and she: \n\u201cMight these be fairy rings? Am I bewitched?\u201d\n\nI stood aghast like you, helpless and mute\u2009\u2014\u2009\nshe takes my hand\u2009\u2014\u2009her breath on me, her bright \neyes on me all this time\u2009\u2014\u2009and draws me near \nuntil, as a flower at the end of day\ncloses upon a raindrop, my fingers close\nupon her trembling warmth\u00a0...\u00a0But\u2009\u2014\u2009one more glass,\nsir, one more glass of wine before you go!\nNow, I insist: the parish will be yours\ntomorrow.

Now let me beg your further judgment.\nI mean John Knowles. You must have heard the name\u2009\u2014\u2009\nhe was notorious even in his youth\nwhen he was summoned, twice, before the synod.\nPastor of Brandeston? That was his title,\nthough if he sought to make a fair show in the flesh\nsuch is the devil\u2019s business! An old man?\nCertain as I am I, but young enough\nto play the knave with us, making us run\nhim back and forth three nights and days together\nbefore he would confess to having sunk \na sailing vessel out of Ipswich\u00a0...\u00a0and yet\nwhen it came (after much wrestling,\nnot to begrudge our toil) the fall was swift.\n\nDrag a man from his last-but-one defence\u2009\u2014\u2009\nand then stand down. Have patience. He will yield.\nPermit his vanity one bauble\u2009\u2014\u2009he is apt\nto cast it back at you, for pride achieves\nits final flower in authoring its own \ndefeat. I say his was a free confession.\nDid it not grieve you to have made\nfourteen new widows in a quarter-hour?\n(I waited his reply.) No, he was joyful \nto see the power his imps possessed.\nDid you not fear the gallows or the stake?\nNo, for he had a charm to keep him free.\nAnd do you now repent your wickedness?\nNo. Cruel malice was his chief delight.\n\nHis was the only execution that we witnessed.\nBefore he was brought out, they cut his tongue\n(\u201cWe must have no more juggling from you, John\u201d)\nand stripped him to his shirt. They fastened him\nwith shackles and a steel brace to the stake\nand hung a bag of powder round his neck.\nThen officers stacked reed and faggots\nabout his body, and set fire on the reed\u2009\u2014\u2009\nthe wind being high, this took no little time\u2009\u2014\u2009\nand as I was so jostled in the press\nI saw no more until a great flame rose \n(the crowd fell silent then) that sparkled and deformed\nthe visor of his face\u2009\u2014\u2009and so at last \nthe powder caught, and he gave up the ghost.\n\nHow enviously life clings to its toy\nand then casts it aside! Broiled black, puffed up,\nKnowles suffered great extremity in his death,\nwhich notwithstanding he had borne with patience\u2009\u2014\u2009\nand it seemed the people were impressed by this\nfor as they went their ways some doffed their hats,\ncausing my companion to cry out\nthat Knowles was scandalous, that he had carried himself \nas though he were the holy sacrament \neven unto the stake, and that they had\ndone right to send the wolf back whence he came;\nand while he spoke, I noted his pale brow\nand the unseasonable bloom upon his cheeks,\nfor these were signs. He died within the year.\n\nKnow this: the instrument whereby God called\nso many to knowledge, so many to salvation;\nthe man of letters that readily could give\nin any matter of controversy\na godly learned sentence; the man of law\nwho persecuted in excess of two\nhundred and fifty witches\u2009\u2014\u2009of whom more\nthan half were duly executed\u2009\u2014\u2009passed\npeacefully in his bed of a consumption,\nnot greatly troubled in his conscience as\nyou may have falsely heard, nor was he once\nsuspected. And with great zeal he went about\nhis godly work some two years unmolested\nuntil the Lord in mercy gave him rest.\n\nI tried to see a life continuing the trade,\ntaking our method north through Lincolnshire,\nperhaps to Scotland where the savages\nbusied themselves designing ever crueller tortures\u2009\u2014\u2009\nwas this my mission? To enlighten them?\u2009\u2014\u2009\nbut no: I made for home with tales to tell,\ntook up my father\u2019s ministry and in time\npersuaded Alice to forgive my leaving her.\nSome discoverers, seeking to be justified, \nhave published tedious apologies,\nbut such comes too near tendering a confession. \nOur sanction may be found in the Book of Exodus\ntwenty-two, eighteen. I have committed \n(and need commit) nothing further to record.\n\nWhat comes back now most clearly, and most often,\nis not the tidy, disembellished funeral \n(he wanted neither psalms nor solemn bells, \nno rosemary to ornament his coffin),\nmuch less my undeniable disappointment\nat learning that he was\u2009\u2014\u2009not quite low-born, \nyet something shy of a true gentleman\u2009\u2014\u2009like me \na minister\u2019s third son (and his mother French!\nShe had escaped, he said, the massacres in Paris);\nbut walking out together that first morning,\nour work before us, when we found the verges lit \nwith new-blown colours\u2009\u2014\u2009bluebells, cornflowers, eyebright\u2009\u2014\u2009\nlike intermeddling voices, so I thought,\neach one contending with its neighbour to be heard.\n\nMy companion walked in silence.\n(Hours would pass before I found the nerve\nto enquire towards what his silence tended,\nand when at last I did, his answer was so short and quick\u2009\u2014\u2009\n\u201cThe days to come\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009I did not ask again.)\nThe sun dazzled my eyes, and I allowed myself\nto fancy we had left the road behind\nand were ascending into the blue ether,\nEngland disappearing far below.\nAlready the syringa was in bloom,\nits scent so concentrated in the dawn\u2009\u2014\u2009\nopen the window: this herb, breathe it now:\nthe smell is like the sweat of a young girl\nwho runs in a summer meadow, is it not?", "title": "The Discoverer\u2019s Man", "id": 58217, "author": "Paul Batchelor"}

{"poem": "An idea is sometimes sweetened by refusing to be expressed,\nif it attends, solicitously, to this failure, and urges us on to\ndiscover the true impediment to its adaptation. In that\nspirit, and bearing that intention within us, we note here, as\nelsewhere, there are generally three alternative courses. The\n\ufb01rst is simply to accept without question an explanation\nsomeone in our proximity, and whom we know, proffers and\nthen elects to modify out of concern that small details are\nescaping to set up camp opposite what is being said. The\nsecond is to surrender one\u2019s reluctance to withdraw from the\npresence of an unsolved problem by grabbing crudely at\nvacant affirmations that nothing further need be done, that\neverything to be accomplished was accomplished well before\ncurrent advocates approached the threshold, coaxed forward\nby the desire to indulge their own vanity.

{"poem": "1. spent\nIn Sonnet 19, Milton makes the seemingly deliberate choice to avoid \u201cthe\u201d and \u201ca\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009respectively, the most common and the sixth most common words in English usage. Instead of these articles\u2009\u2014\u2009\u2028definite and indefinite\u2009\u2014\u2009the poem stages a territorial dispute between \u2028possessives: the octave is \u201cmy\u201d land, the sestet is \u201chis\u201d land, with the occasional \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthat\u201d flagging no man\u2019s land. We come to understand Milton\u2019s mistake\u2009\u2014\u2009the professed regret of the poem\u2009\u2014\u2009as this act of claiming. It is only through his taking possession that the universal light is divided up, apportioned into \u201cmy light\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009a finite commodity that by being subjected to ownership becomes capable of being \u201cspent.\u201d\nMy mistake was similar. I came to consider my body\u2009\u2014\u2009its tug-of-war of tautnesses and slacknesses\u2009\u2014\u2009to be entirely my own, an appliance for generating various textures and temperatures of friction. Should I have known, then, that by this act of self-claiming, I was cutting \u2028myself off from the eternal, the infinite, that I had fashioned myself into a resource that was bounded and, therefore, exhaustible?\n2. wide\nThe \u201cwide\u201d is always haunted by surprise. In a dark world, the \u201cwide\u201d is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness, the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs. To be bounded is our usual condition; to be open is anomalous, even excessive.\u00a0\nA wide-eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness, her bare membranes flinching at any contact, vulnerable to motes, to smuts, to dryness. A wide-hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide. A wide-legged girl unseals a portal between persons; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers, a trapdoor that must be shut for safety\u2019s sake. A wide-eyed girl is often thought desirable; a wide-hipped girl is often thought eligible; a wide-legged girl is often thought deplorable. A wide-legged girl is rarely wide-eyed, though she may have started out that way.\nWe can understand why Milton, in the narrowing orbit of his blindness, would have considered wideness, unboundedness to be threatening. What\u2019s less clear is why the wideness of the wide-legged girl is also considered threatening. Does the wideness of the wide-legged girl evoke a kind of blindness, a dark room where one might blunder into strangers, the way two men once met each other in me?\n3. hide\n\u201cBut why hide it in a hole?\u201d asks the Master, returning from his long absence, sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage.\u00a0\nAn unanswered question worries at the Parable of the Talents: why is the Master so terribly angry? It is not as if the servant had stolen the money, or spent it\u2014his sin is one of omission, of overly risk-averse investing. A talent was a unit of weight in ancient Greece: in monetary terms, it was worth eighty pounds of silver, or 6,000 denarii\u2014nearly twenty years\u2019 wages for the average worker. But Milton uses the word in its more modern sense, dating from the fifteenth century: a natural ability or skill.\nHow did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn, innate? Confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem. The Master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed. Was the servant\u2019s fault to confuse coins for seeds, did he think he was planting when he was merely burying, did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living, what had never been alive?\n4. bent\nAnd what about the hole, which for so long had held treasure? Did it wonder why \u2014 despite all the moistness and richness it could muster \u2014 those cold, glinting seeds never sprouted? Did it understand that, if released into the wider world, the coins could have quickened, multiplied? That instead of an incubator, the hole had become an oubliette, a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish, to become lodged, useless?\n\u201cUseless\u201d \u2014 a word like a capped lead pipe, like the extra bone in my foot I will never pass down to my daughter.\nA thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape. To \u201cget bent\u201d is to be put to another kind of use, a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape. To bend is to be bound, to bow down without breaking, with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward.\n5. present\nThe Master has become the Maker. The servile body wholly \u201chis,\u201d splayed wide in a welcome-home, bound up in a beribboned bow.\u00a0\nBut the reader will object. This is all wrong. First of all, in the sonnet, \u201cbent\u201d doesn\u2019t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force, but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination. Second, a \u201cpresent\u201d is not a gift, but a verb meaning to offer openly, full-faced, the sun beaming down on a clean page. Third, the body never comes into it at all.\n6. chide\nIs a \u201ctrue account\u201d a story or a sum? Is the Maker an audience or an auditor?\u00a0\nThe page scoured white by little grains of fear.\nA story has an ending. A sum has a bottom line. There was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me, month after month, I scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime.\nThen one day the fear reversed itself. Like a photo negative but in higher contrast\u2014its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy, as if a whisper-thin suspicion had come unzipped.\n\u201cChide\u201d is an enormous understatement. The servant isn\u2019t merely scolded, he is cast into \u201cthe outer darkness\u201d where there is \u201cweeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d If the \u201couter darkness\u201d is deemed to be a punishment, then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward?\n7. denied\nIt seems unfair, is Milton\u2019s point. To be assigned a task, but not provided sufficient materials to complete it, is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity, like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale.\nThe Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins\u2014which prefaces the Parable of the Talents \u2014 centers on this scarcity. The virgins wait for the bridegroom, to greet him with lamps alight. Five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil, but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil. That much we are told, but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story. Why isn\u2019t the bridegroom with the bride? Why is he so delayed? Why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp-bearing virgins, like a troupe of pom-pom girls or like a sacrificial rite?\nThe virginity of the virgins renders them piquant, memorable. Adorning gothic portals, evoking thresholds, entrances, they are a particular feature of French cathedrals\u2014much more so, one suspects, than if the parable had called them \u201cmaidservants\u201d or even \u201cbridesmaids.\u201d\nThe presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much: the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast, the smug, unctuous faces of the wise virgins. Instead, the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night, their desperation making them vulnerable, their vulnerability making them erotic, the fill-holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil. Is this how I was taught to sexualize insufficiency, the lack that set me wandering night after night, my body too early emptied out?\n8. prevent\n\u201cPrevent\u201d \u2014 a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth.\nA white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away, leaving a star-shaped scar. Corpus albicans, the whitening body. Such starbursts, at first, are scattered constellations, frost embroidering a dark field. But at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility, opacity, obstacle\u2014the ice disc clogging the round pond, the grid of proteins baffling the eye?\n\u201cPrevent\u201d \u2014 a word that slams shut, a portcullis (Latin: cataracta).\nLetter to Leonard Philaras, September 28, 1654: \u201cthe dimness which I experience by night and day, seems to incline more to white than to black.\u201d\n9. need\nHas Patience been looming in the background all along, silent, so as not to intrude upon a blind man\u2019s consciousness? Patience, whose garment is \u201cwhite and close-fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind.\u201d\nAt the turn of the sonnet, Patience pries open its sculpted lips, its stiff tongue like a weaver\u2019s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of Milton\u2019s blindness, a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder.\nMilton\u2019s little murmur stitched back into his mouth.\nWoven tight enough to repel need \u2014 a liquid beading on the surface, the blood the needles drew from me week after week, hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin, en route to the incinerator.\n\u201cNeed,\u201d from the High German, for danger.\n\u201cMurmur,\u201d from the Sanskrit, a crackling fire.\n10. best\nThe best beam in contentment, ranging themselves in rows. Erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness, mustering shoulder-to-shoulder with the fellow-elect. The best arrayed in regimental ranks, in refrigerated racks, white hymn of the unneeded, white hum of the unneeding.\n\u201cBest,\u201d originally superlative of bot (Old English: remedy, reparation).\nThe best affect a pious pose, mouths held taut in tongueless Os. Sotto voce chorus of that soft, subjunctive song: if you were complete ... if you were replete ...\nSuperlative. The most remediated. The most repaired.\n11. state\nTo be scooped out, emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears, pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table. Enucleated, the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk.\n\u201cYolk\u201d from geolu (Old English: yellow). Not to be confused with \u201cyoke\u201d from geocian (Old English: to be joined together). A yoke is an implement, meant to be used, to fill a need. But where there is no field to be plowed, no wagon to be pulled, why demand a yoke that is useless, needless?\nOne day the Romans sent for Cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading Aequian army. He laid down his plow in the field and went to war. When the Aequians surrendered, Cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must \u201cpass under the yoke.\u201d The Romans fashioned a yoke from three spears, two fixed in the ground, and one tied across the tops of the two verticals. Since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground, the Aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender. This is thought to be the origin of the word \u201csubjugate,\u201d to be brought under the yoke. To bear a yoke is to be bowed down, oxbowed, cowed.\nOne day they laid me down on a gurney, my feet strapped in stirrups, my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull.\n12. speed\nBut why would Milton, of all people, use the word \u201cKingly\u201d as a compliment? Roundheaded Milton, who wrote tract after tract in defense of regicide, who would later be detained for opposing the Restoration?\nAt this point, our suspicions are confirmed: Milton has disappeared entirely from the poem. We haven\u2019t heard from him since the turn of the sonnet. We\u2019ve been lulled by the cadenced voice of Patience, its dusty tongue self-lubricating, its pallid breath clouding the room, precipitating frangible chains of hydrocarbons, their branchings barbed like fluffs of eiderdown. Through the faint reticulations, we discern no dark stoop-shouldered figure, but only white-robed forms, upright as if hung from hooks, their faces unyielding as lanterns, shuttered as if once aflame.\n13. rest\nRest \u2014 a word like a gauze bandage, a ropy weave of collagen knitting its way across a wound. Outspread as if fingered, gelid gestures suggesting solace: to stanch, to shield, to seal, to shut off.\nRest \u2014 the rind of the best, a contoured pod that cradles the shape of what it doesn\u2019t hold.\nRest \u2014 those who are left when thousands have sped away, the bereft, who litter the land, with husks for hands, vacant-eyed, vacant faces raised like basins under a contrail-scarred sky.\n14. wait\nTo stand and wait is a task far weightier than simply to wait. It is to permit the distractible body neither ease nor action, nor food nor drink nor any such reprieve; it is to pit the body in enmity against its own heaviness.\nTo abide in readiness as in a winter orchard, the lacerated land bandaged in snow. To exist inert as if limbless, skin seamless as if reknit over what had been pruned away, knotted rootstock fit for no other service: no branch, no leaf, no fruit. To persist as a stripped stick persists in a white field, bark peeled back from one exposed split, uptilted as if eager for the grafted slip.\nTo stand and wait for the one who reaps where he has not sown.\nMercy sugars the starving soil with nitrogen, potassium, phosphate. Mercy captures rain in silver beads and stitches them through the threadbare weave of cloud. Mercy wields a scalpel cutting a cleft in the lopped-off stump, mercy forces home the rootless wand, mercy seals the join with tar and tape.\nTo foster the raw scion as if it were a son, to siphon light down through its body as if it were your own.", "title": "Blackacre", "id": 58147, "author": "Monica Youn"}

Mate!\nWhat is the use of talking, until I end my song,\nI end my song in the dark.\nI call in the nurse,\nHold the pill in my hand\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she says, \u201cTake this,\u201d\nAnd swallow it down, silent.\n", "title": "Chinese Silence No. 92", "id": 58163, "author": "Timothy Yu"}

{"poem": "Who was the woman who lived in the kingdom behind the barrier.\nThere are those who will tell you she was the wife of every man in the village.\nAnd one night while her husbands were finishing their day at the gasworks,\nthe woman was boiling oats for her only child,\na young girl who\u2019d amassed a beautiful collection of spoons in her life,\neach one given to her by one of her mother\u2019s husbands.\nAnd this same night the young daughter died.\nAnd the woman buried the daughter with her spoons in her pockets.\nCome daybreak the hostiles appeared at the barrier with ice in their beards.\n\u201cTo hell with Pax Americana,\u201d they said.\nAnd they camped outside the wall that night chanting war cries.\nYou say you want to know the names of the war cries that survived history.\n\u201cWheel the gun carriages up to the barrier of the empire of husbands.\u201d\n\u201cOur first word is ruin and our next word is value.\u201d\nThere are those who will tell you the hostiles carried on like this for some weeks.\nUntil one night the dead daughter led them behind the barrier,\nthrough a tunnel she\u2019d dug in the earth with her spoons.\nIt was thus the hostiles made it their business to burn everything.\nThey burned the village crops and the distillery.\nThey burned the apothecary, the potash mine.\nBlack soot fell on the livery and they burned the livery too.\nAnd there\u2019s another war cry that\u2019s since survived history:\n\u201cTonight like god\u2019s scalp in your kingdom behind the barrier\nour burning makes snow and ends nowhere.\u201d\nYou say, where were the village husbands while all of this was \u2028happening.\nThere are those who will tell you they were working their jobs at the gasworks,\nand when they heard the bullhorn roar in the watchtower\nthey were smoking cigarillos and pacing the floor of the gasworks. \nAnd the roar of the bullhorn had a strange effect on the husbands,\nwho each began daydreaming of his wife at home in the village.\nThe first husband thought: \u201cThe taste of the breath of my wife,\nit\u2019s like saying the word houndstooth to myself in the dark.\u201d\nThe next husband thought of her letting her hair down in front of a vanity,\nand smearing her blue eye shadow onto her fingers,\nand plucking the stray hairs and flyaways off her head.\nThe next husband thought of her saying, \u201cI\u2019m correcting god\u2019s blunders,\u201d\nwhen he asked her why she wears all this foundation on her face. \nAnother husband thought: \u201cQuitting time is worthless to me\nso long as the work I do in the gasworks makes me think of my wife\u2019s jawbone.\u201d\nAnd all together the husbands said: \u201cThe jawbones of my wife,\nthey beat both the same, like when I watch a train leave the \u2028kingdom,\nand all I can see is the pistons beating away in the smoke.\u201d\nAnd when the hostiles entered the gasworks the husbands were dancing.\nAnd you say you want to know the words the hostiles spoke when they entered.\nThere are those who will tell you they said this: \u201cDon\u2019t quit dancing.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a penalty for an empire that believes it can survive itself,\u201d they said.\nAnd so they pointed their war clubs at the husbands,\nand they said don\u2019t quit, don\u2019t quit dancing on the floor of the gasworks,\nand they bludgeoned to death the husbands who refused to keep dancing,\nand one by one the husbands fell dead on the floor of the gasworks,\neach one dancing himself to death at the hands of the hostiles.\n\nAnd this dancing took many deaths.\n\nBut you say where was the wife who lost all her husbands this day.\nThere are those who will tell you she was hiding the last of the cheese in a boot.\nShe was rolling up the deed to her house in the village.\nShe was picking up her daughter\u2019s violin and stuffing the scroll in the violin\u2019s f-hole.\nShe was fleeing for the wall when she was stopped by the hostiles.\nDance, said the hostiles, and they pointed their war clubs at her skull.\nAnd these war clubs had a strange effect on the wife,\nwho began daydreaming about a man who wasn\u2019t her husband.\nShe thought of cutting his hair in a sunflower patch in the village.\nThe time should be dusk, she thought, and the shears,\nthey should flash once in her hands like a scythe.\nShe thought there should be two swarms of no-see-ums,\none smoldering around each of her hands.\nAnd she\u2019d tilt back the head of the man who wasn\u2019t her husband.\nAnd she\u2019d oil his throat with the badger brush in her hand.\nAnd he\u2019d smell the sandalwood lather she worked in the bristles.\nAnd he\u2019d smell the eau de cologne on her neck when she leaned in close.\nAnd she\u2019d shave his throat with the blade of a balisong.\nAnd the woman thought each time he moaned when she stroked him\na dragonfly should dance from his mouth.\nAnd he\u2019ll moan until the dragonfly quits dancing, she thought.\nAnd I\u2019ll dance around his throat all night like a lantern.\n\u201cBecause a war club doesn\u2019t taste like a war club,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt tastes like my husbands all breathing at once.\u201d\nShe spoke these words with a hole in her skull in the snow.\nAnd the smoke coming out of the hole was her thoughts.\nAnd her body lying there in the village square was so beautiful\nthe hostiles began to dance on either side of the body.\nAnd they danced, and they danced, until they too fell dead in the snow beside her.\n", "title": "The Dancing Plague", "id": 58155,

{"poem": "1\n\nWe call change in a person the effect of time, witness my new dress, so short,\nwith buttons on the yoke shaped like swans.\n\nI enter from the back of the room, pausing at the hopeful energy of people\ngathered to see me.\n\nThey are a surface, alive and redolent, half unseen, like iridescent cloth.\n\nI sense structure spontaneously form, as when crossing the room to greet you,\nwhat I say forms.\n\nAnd I worry that spontaneity acts for its own reasons, not mine.\n\nMy dress is a visual image of unconscious affirmative processes, the way spontaneity\nexpresses its order, as I create a world, stocking it with small dogs on the runway,\nhandbags, a bouillonne of rose tulle at the waist of a jacket.\n\nSo, I'm not limited to what I observe, rather than feel.\n\n\n2\n\nThey assess quite accurately my choice of babydoll dress as value for others.\n\nEach absorbs encouragement from her assessment, even though every being's\nimprinted with data to create every appearance.\n\nSeeing a leaf may reveal knowledge that communicates instantly among\nmicrobes, which can change in a wink.\n\nSo, the optimistic idea would be the most biologically pertinent one.\n\nI dress to express a hoped for solution.\n\nRachel's blouse, for example, is not purple just for photographers' enjoyment.\n\nFlowers are intrinsic to her feeling for her value, she seeks by expression to extend.\n\nEach guest creates her own sumptuous panoply from my honey sable coat over\nsilvery pajamas, new, vintage, because of simultaneous time, therefore matter.\n\nSo, physical change is not time, as such.\n\n\n3\n\nI feel love from the fashion community as light from photographs of others' bodies\nas light from their scrutiny of my photograph in a dress bold enough to sustain\nthe penetration of disembodied light of my entrance.\n\nTo audience, unnamed cutters, sewers, embroiderers, beaders I attribute this beauty,\nwhen meaning i.e., style, is given a sympathetic presence.\n\nMirroring touches it, like exquisite jet beads on a gray coatdress in almost\ntransparent boucl\u00e9, clusters of dark stones on the shoulder.\n\nA loose blouse in cream silk crepe is tied at the sleeves with glistening cellophane\nribbons.\n\nYou feel I understand your own contingency plans.\n\nDo you remember my show in London, when all the models were drunk, broken\nglass everywhere?\n\nFashion does that, giving shape and color to our inarticulate impulses.\n\nI present the contemporary as liminal, transitions, transparencies.\n\nYou nurture the uncontained confusion, when no permeable resonance has yet\u00a0\nformed.\n\nThe gray is cloudy, deep, but without melancholy.\n\n\n4\n\nBefore dinner, we're asked to sign the guestbook on a Boulle console in the hall.\n\nPeople I've seen in magazines seem very tall, their features enlarged from being\nphotographed.\n\nEach appearance has a materiality more significant than we usually expect from\nbodies.\n\nStyle, soul, is power through which matter is formed.\n\nLike historic change, a body can re-materialize in its chrysalis, when the life you\nknow is left behind.\n\nYou're alone in a white brocade jacket with fur trim and frosting white cloque, a\nskirt of stiff flounces, like quartz crystals flecked with gold.\n\nIn this chrysalis, you now change the contemporary, viewing the past in\nextending light that's mobile around your body.\n\nMy dress is not stuck in time like a butterfly born in a jar, whose wings are\ntherefore useless.\n\n\n5\n\nIn the dining room, with Ming wallpaper restored by young Chinese artists, Kiki\nwears a blue silk coat embroidered with gold.\n\nI mention Louise's white helmet, Camilla on pewter platforms flashing to gold,\nlight on water, what we mean visually by souls for whom the the body is potential,\nfutural.\n\nIn my closet, there's no distinction between material and the intelligible.\n\nWhen I continue to dress after I tell \u00a0him my dog has died, he begins to weep.\n\nHe asks how I can waste this evening chattering?\n\nI say through tears I mourn my little dog, but that means little to him, because of\u00a0\nmy outfit.\n\nHe makes a mistake in reading, like a wrong accessory, inserting an extra vowel\nor syllable and changing the whole passage, though I don't usually wear sheer\nstockings with that dress.\n\nIt was a case of spontaneity, a transparent white warp like an open window\nthrough which a moment is perceived, unshaded by the physical.\n\nAnd in fact, many in the room were not in good health.\n\nThrough this window, I take in a non-causative molecule to change myself, what\na mother administers, placebo, the intent of a dress.\n\nWhen you wear it for the first time, you're surprised by a rush of feeling for\nyourself.\n\n\n\n", "title": "A Placebo", "id": 58185, "author": "Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge"}

Everything clouded. \nYesterday 1 couldn't tear myself from the news \n& already today the events have been distorted, \nthe numbers downplayed. It's late fall\n& in the early morning crispness, the leaves\nfall from the trees & cover the sidewalks.\u00a0\nThis new feeling we lack a name for, struggle\nmanifested in the streets & in parks & on bridges\nacross the nation. The headlines read\n\"Protesters clash with police,\" but as we watched\nthe live stream, we saw aggression only by officers\ndressed in riot gear. We saw people tossed\non the ground, hit with batons,\na woman punched in the face, an eighty-four year old\nwoman's face drenched in pepper spray.\nThe images endless in this land of the free.\nI'm losing focus, distracted by the newsfeed\non the computer screen, hitting refresh.\nThe cat paws at my leg, demands its own attention.\nThis shift entirely unexpected but necessary.\nLeaves blot the window.

{"poem": "One might understand Turner, you said, in North Atlantic sky\neast-southeast from Newfoundland toward Hibernia.\nCloud darker than cloud cast doubt upon muttering, pacing water, even\nbacklit by a devouring glare that whitened its edges,\nbent the bars. Waters apart from society by choice, their living room \nthe aftermath of accident or crime. When the storm comes,\nwe will see into it, there will be no near and no far. In sixty-five-foot \u2028seas\nfor the Ocean Ranger, green turned to black then white as molecules\nchanged places in the Jeanne d\u2019Arc Basin, the way wood passes into\nflame, and communication errors into catastrophic failure\nfor the Piper Alpha offshore from Aberdeen.\n\nIt burned freely. If I don\u2019t come home, is my house in order?\nBig fear travels in the Sikorsky. Twelve-hour shifts travel with them, \nthe deluge system, aqueous foam. Machinery\u2019s one note\nhammering the heart, identity compressed with intentions, drenched,\nthe tired body performs delicately timed, brutal tasks no training\nadequately represents and which consume the perceivable world.\nIn beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbelief,\nidentified by the unlovely sea\u2019s aggression, no sleep aids,\nshould a directive come. Underwater welders deeply unconscious.\nSurvival suits profane in lockers. By dreams of marine flares\nand inflatables, buoyant smoke, percolating fret,\none is weakened. Violence enters the imagination.\n\nClouds previously unrecorded. Unlocked, the gates of light\nand technology of capture in bitumen oozing from fractures\nin the earth or afloat like other fatty bodies, condensed\nby sun and internal salts, harassing snakes with its fumes.\nLight-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce\nrecorded the view from his bedroom. It looked nice. A new kind\nof evidence developed from the camera obscura of experience\nand memory, love-object to dote on and ignore. Collectible \nphotochrome postcards. Storm surge as weather segment,\ntornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom. In the rain,\u00a0\ndrizzle, intermittent showers, unseasonable hurricane threatening \nour flight plans, against a sea heaving photogenically, \nstraining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs, on wet stones \nastonishingly slick, we take selfies, post them, and can\u2019t undo it.\n\nMeaning takes place in time. By elevated circumstance \nof Burtynsky\u2019s drone helicopters, revolutionary lenses \npester Alberta\u2019s tar sands, sulphur ponds\u2019 rhapsodic upturned faces, \nphotographs that happen in our name and in the name \nof composition. Foreground entered at distance, the eye surveils \nthe McMurray Formation\u2019s freestanding ruin mid-aspect \nto an infinity of abstraction. A physical symptom assails \nour vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which \none does not recover. Mineral dissolution, complete. Accommodation space,\u00a0\nlow. Confinement, relatively broad, extremely complex stratigraphy,\u00a0\nreservoirs stacked and composite. An area roughly the size\nof England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg, unburdened \nby hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden. Humiliated,\nblinded, walking in circles. Cycle of soak and dry and residue. \n\nThe will creates effects no will can overturn, and that seem, \nwith the passage of time, necessary, as the past assumes a pattern. \nThought approaches the future and the future, \nlike a heavy unconventional oil, advances. Hello infrastructure, \nDodge Ram 1500, no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63, \nthe all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain \nunmoved by our schedules. White crosses in the ditches, \nwhite crosses in the glove box. The west stands for relocation, the east\u00a0\nfor lost causes. Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant \nthe rest of your life? I thought not. Drinks are on us bushpigs now,\u00a0\nthough this camp is no place for a tradesman. Devon\u2019s Jackfish is five-star,\u00a0\nan obvious exception. But Mackenzie, Voyageur, Millennium, Borealis\u2009\u2014\nyears ago we would have burned them to the ground. Suncor Firebag\u00a0\n\nhas Wi-Fi, but will track usage. Guard towers and turnstiles at Wapasu\u2009\u2014\nwe\u2019re guests, after all, not prisoners, right?\u00a0\nEfficiently squalid, briskly producing raw sewage, black mold, \nbotulism, fleas, remorse, madness, lethargy, mud, it\u2019s not \na spiritual home, this bleach taste in the waterglass, layered garments,\u00a0\nfried food, bitter complaint in plywood drop-ceiling bedrooms strung out\non whatever and general offense and why doesn\u2019t anyone smoke \nanymore. Dealers and prostitutes cultivate their terms \norganically, as demand matures. The Athabasca River\u2019s color isn\u2019t good.\nShould we not encourage a healthy dread of\u200athe wild places?\nConsider the operator crushed by a slab of ice, our electrician mauled\u00a0\nby a bear at the front lines of project expansion\ninto the inhumane forest. Fear not, we are worth more than many sparrows.\nThey pay for insignificance with their lives. It\u2019s the structure.\n\nJackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the day,\nin the minutes before sunset it\u2019s still legal to hunt. One might,\nlike Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s Wanderer, at a certain remove\nfrom principal events, cut a sensitive figure in the presence\nof the sublime. Except you can smell it down here. Corrosive\nvapors unexpectedly distributed, caustic particulate infiltrates\nyour mood. As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars, from whom\ngrown men run. Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compound\nemitted by damaged trees on which it feeds, its aural signature\napproximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together.\nThe only other living thing in situ, in the open pit where swims\u00a0\nthe bitumen, extra brilliant, dense, massive, in the Greek asphaltos,\n\u201cto make stable,\u201d \u201cto secure.\u201d Pharmacist\u2019s earth that resists decay,\nresolves and attenuates, cleanses wounds. Once used to burn\nthe houses of our enemies, upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstock,\nraw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution.\u00a0\nCombustion is our style. It steers all things from the black grave\nof Athabasca-Wabiskaw. Cold Lake. Rail lines of\n\nLac-M\u00e9gantic. The optics are bad. We\u2019re all downstream now.\nAction resembles waiting for a decision made\non our behalf, then despair after the fact. Despair which,\nlike bitumen itself, applied to render darker tones or an emphatic\ntenebrism, imparts a velvety lustrous disposition,\nbut eventually discolors to a black treacle that degrades\nany pigment it contacts. Details in sections of\u00a0Raft of the Medusa\ncan no longer be discerned. In 1816, the Medusa\u2019s captain,\nin a spasm of flamboyant incompetence, ran aground\non the African coast, and fearing the ire of his constituents,\nrefused to sacrifice the cannons. They turned on each other,\n147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboats\nof the wealthy and well-connected. The signs were there,\n\nrisk/reward coefficient alive in the wind, the locomotive,\nsmall tragic towns left for work, where the only thing manufactured \nis the need for work. Foreshortening and a receding horizon\ninclude the viewer in the scene, should the viewer wish\nto be included in the scene. One can\u2019t be sure if the brig, Argus,\nis racing to the rescue or departing. It hesitates in the distance,\nin its nimbus of fairer weather, the courage and compassion\nof a new age onboard. G\u00e9ricault\u2019s pyramidical composition\u2009\u2014\ndead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upward\ntoward an emotional peak\u2009\u2014\nan influence for Turner\u2019s Disaster at Sea, the vortex structure of\nThe Slave Ship: all those abandoned, where is thy market now?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine everyone saved, it\u2019s unaffordable. Waves\ndisproportionate, organized in depth, panic modulating\nthe speaking voice. The situation so harshly primary and not beautiful\nwhen you don\u2019t go to visit the seaside, but the seaside visits you,\nrudely, breaks in through the basement, ascends stairs\nto your bedroom, you can\u2019t think of it generally then. The \u2028constitution\nof things is accustomed to hiding. Rearrangement will not suit us.\nCertain low-lying river deltas. Island states, coastal regions\u2009\u2014\nfloodwaters receding in measures like all we haven\u2019t seen the last of\nreveal in stagnancies and bloat what\u2019s altered, as avernal exhalations\nof mines and flares are altered but don\u2019t disappear. Still,\niceberg season is spectacular this year, worth the trip\nto photograph in evening ourselves before the abundance when, aflame\nin light that dissolves what it illuminates, water climbs \nits own red walls, vermilion in the furnaces.\n", "title": "Bitumen", "id": 58088, "author": "Karen Solie"}

{"poem": "On an island, an open road \nwhere an animal has been crushed \nby something larger than itself.\n\nIt is mangled by four o'clock light, soul \nsour-sweet, intestines flattened and raked\n by the sun, eyes still watchful, savage.\n\nThis landscape of Taiwan looks like a body\nblack and blue. On its coastline mussels have cracked\ntheir faces on rocks, clouds are collapsing\n\nonto tiny houses. And just now a monsoon has begun. \nIt reminds me of a story my father told me: \nHe once made the earth not in seven days\n\nbut in one. His steely joints wielded lava and water\nand mercy in great ionic perfection.\nHe began the world, hammering the length\n\nof trees, trees like a war of families,\ntrees which fumbled for grand gesture.\nThe world began in an explosion of fever and rain.\n\nHe said, Tina, your body came out floating. \nI was born in the middle of monsoon season, \npalm trees tearing the tin roofs.\n\nNow as I wander to the center of the island\nno one will speak to me. My dialect left somewhere\nin his pocket, in a nursery book,\n\na language of childsplay. Everything unfurls\nin pictures: soil is washed from the soles of feet, a woman\nruns toward her weeping son, chicken bones float\n\nin a pot full of dirty water.\nI return to the animal on the road.\nWhen I stoop to look at it\n\nit smells of trash, rotting vegetation,\nthe pitiful tongue. Its claws are curled tight\nto its heart; eyes open eyes open.\n\nWhen the world began\nin the small factory of my father's imagination\nhe never spoke of this gnarled concoction\n\nof bone and blood that is nothing like wonder\nbut just the opposite, something\nsimply ravaged. He too would die soon after\n\nthe making of the world. I would go on\nwaking, sexing, mimicking enemies.\nI would go on coaxed by gravity and hard science.\n\n\n", "title": "Invention", "id": 57913, "author": "Tina Chang"}

In the shipyard,\n\nI worked alone, in the dark, deep in\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0the bilges of frigates. For two months, \nI hooked a torch to an oxygen tank with a green line and pulled a red\n\nhose through bulkheads to gas. The brass tool\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 hissed like an ostrich \nwhen it fed on metal. That day, my flame cut\n\npermanent deck fittings; the loops fell like bright oranges;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I ripened the rusty metal. I knew \nthat this was a job to baby-sit me, a job they gave to bad burners,\n\nbeginners playing with their tools: who pretended their brass torches\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0were trumpets, and that gulls in the bay were tables \nof distracted diners. When my father was a boy, his father loaded him\n\nand his siblings in the car and dropped them off downtown\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0so my grandfather could get drunk and my \ngrandmother could pretend he wasn't drinking again.

As I grew, I tried \nto stay away from work, even when he paid me. I stayed away from him too.\n\nI never understood how he could work around so much grass. For him,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 life was work. For him, everything was hard. For me, \nit was not hard.

The hip-hirple\nof a white horse against purple.\nAge-old traductions I could trace\nfrom freebasers pretending they freebase\nto this inescapable flaw\nhidden by Carlotta's close-knit wet suit\nlike a heart-wound by a hauberk.\n\nBannockburn\n\nThough he was mounted on a cob\nrather than a warhorse, the Bruce\nstill managed to sidestep a spear\nfrom Henry de Bohun and tax\nde Bohun's poll with his broad-based poleax\nand leave de Bohun's charger somewhat leer.\nHer grandfather had yet to find a use\nfor the two-timing partisan\nhis grandfather brought man-to-man\nagainst all those Ferdinandies\nuntil he saw it might come in handy\nfor whacking the thingammybobs\noff pine and fir, off pine and fir and spruce\nand all such trees as volunteer.\n\nBerwick-Upon-Tweed\n\nOff the elm, the ancient pollard\nthat a Flemish painter might love,\nthat comes to shun the attention\nof its headstrong days, so is proof\nagainst the storm that takes its neighbor's roof.\nHer nonno collects his pension\nknowing that when push really came to shove\nhe had it within him to wrap\nhis legs in puttees and backslap\nthose pack mules down that moonlit deck,\nCarlotta now wearing a halter-neck\nunder the long-sleeved, high-collared\nwet suit whereof . . . whereof . . . whereof . . . whereof\nI needs must again make mention.\n\nBlaye\n\nHer wet suit like a coat of mail\nworn by a French knight from the time\na knight could still cause a ruction\nby direct-charging his rouncy,\nwhen an Englishman's home was his bouncy\ncastle, when abduction and seduction\nwent hand in glove. Now Carlotta would climb\nfrom the hotel pool in Nashville,\ntake off her mask, and set a spill\nto a Gauloise as one might set\na spill to the fuse of a falconet\nand the walls of her chest assail.\nThe French, meanwhile, were still struggling to prime\ntheir weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBosworth Field\n\nIt was clear now, through the pell-mell\nof bombard- and basilisk-mist,\nthat the Stanleys had done the dirt\non him and taken Henry's side.\nNow Richard's very blood seemed to have shied\naway from him, seemed to sputter and spurt\nlike a falcon sheering off from his wrist\nas he tried to distance himself\nfrom the same falchioneer who'd pelf\nthe crown from his blood-matted brow\nand hang it in a tree. Less clear was how\nhe'd managed not to crack the shell\nof the pigeon egg the size of a cyst\nhe'd held so close inside his shirt\n\nBlackwater Fort\n\nAs I had held Carlotta close\nthat night we watched some Xenophon\nembedded with the 5th Marines\nin the old Sunni Triangle\nmake a half-assed attempt to untangle\nthe ghastly from the price of gasoline.\nThere was a distant fanfaron\nin the Nashville sky, where the wind\nhad now drawn itself up and pinned\non her breast a Texaco star.\n\"Why,\" Carlotta wondered, \"the House of Tar?\nMight it have to do with the gross\nimports of crude oil Bush will come clean on\nonly when the Tigris comes clean?\"\n\nBenburb\n\nThose impromptu chevaux-de-frise \ninto which they galloped full tilt \nand impaled themselves have all but \nthrown off their balance the banner-\nbearing Scots determined to put manners \non the beech mast- and cress- and hazelnut-\neating Irish. However jerry-built, \nthose chevaux-de-frise have embogged \nthe horses whose manes they had hogged \nso lovingly and decked with knots \nof heather, horses rooted to the spots \non which they go down on their knees \nas they unwind their shoulder plaids and kilts, \nthe checkered careers of their guts.\n\nBoyne\n\nThe blood slick from the horse slaughter\nI could no longer disregard\nas Carlotta surfaced like barm.\nMy putting her through her paces\nas she kicked and kicked against the traces\nlike a pack mule kicking from a yardarm\nbefore it fell, heehaw, in the dockyard.\nA banner's frittering tassel\nor deflating bouncy castle\nwas something to which she paid heed\nwhereas that vision of a milk-white steed\ndrinking from a tub of water\nand breathing hard, breathing a little hard,\nhad barely set off an alarm.\n\nBlenheim\n\nSmall birds were sounding the alert\nas I followed her unladen\nsteed through a dell so dark and dank\nshe might have sported the waders\nher grandfather had worn at the nadir\nof his career, scouring the Outer Banks\nfor mummichog and menhaden.\nThose weeks and months in the doldrums\ncoming back as he ran his thumb\nalong an old venetian blind\nin the hope that something might come to mind,\nthat he might yet animadvert\nthe maiden name of that Iron Maiden\non which he was drawing a blank.\n\nBunker Hill\n\nCarlotta took me in her arms\nas a campfire gathers a branch\nto itself, her mouth a cauter\nset to my bleeding bough, heehaw.\nHer grandfather sterilizing his saw\nin a tub of 100-proof firewater,\na helper standing by to stanch\nthe bleeding in some afterlife.\nNo looking daggers at the knife.\nShe'd meet the breast-high parapet\nwith the nonchalance, the no fucking sweat\nof a slightly skanky schoolmarm\nthough the surgeon was preparing to ganch\nher like What's-his-face's Daughter.\n\nBrandywine\n\nI crouched in my own Little Ease\nby the pool at the Vanderbilt\nwhere Carlotta crouched, sputter-sput,\njust as she had in the scanner\nwhen the nurse, keen-sighted as a lanner,\npicked out a tumor like a rabbit scut\non dark ground. It was as if a fine silt,\nwhite sand or silicate, had clogged\nher snorkel, her goggles had fogged,\nand Carlotta surfaced like flot\nto be skimmed off some great cast-iron pot\nas garble is skimmed off, or lees\npainstakingly drained by turnings and tilts\nfrom a man-size barrel or butt.\n\nBadli-Ke-Serai\n\nPork barrels. Pork butts. The wide-screen\nsurround sound of a massed attack\nupon the thin red cellulose\nby those dust- or fust- or must-cells\nthat cause the tears to well and well and well.\nAt which I see him turning up his nose\nas if he'd bitten on a powder-pack\nlike yet another sad Sepoy\nwho won't fall for the British ploy\nof greasing with ham the hammer\nor smoothing over Carlotta's grammar:\n\"On which . . . On which Bush will come clean.\"\nHer grandfather a man who sees no lack\nof manhood in the lachrymose.\n\nBull Run\n\nWhile some think there's nothing more rank \nthan the pool that's long stood aloof\n from the freshet, I loved the smell \nof sweat and blood and, s\u00ed, horse dung\n Carlotta shouldered like an Aqua-Lung\n as she led me now through that dewy dell \nand spread her House of Tartan waterproof. \nAs we lay there I could have sworn,\n as I stared through unruffled thorns \nthat were an almost perfect fit \nto each side of the gravel pit \nwhere she and I'd tried to outflank \neach other, I traced the mark of a hoof \n(or horseshoe) in her fontanelle.\n\nBronkhorstspruit\n\nI traced the age-old traduction\nof a stream through a thorn thicket\nas a gush from a farthingale.\nSkeffington's Daughter. Skeffington.\nAttention. Shun. Attention. Shun. Shun. Shun.\nWe lay in a siding between two rails\nand watched an old white horse cross the picket\nof himself and trek through the scrub\nto drink from an iron-hooped tub\nwith the snore-snort of a tuba.\nHis winkers and bellyband said scuba,\nwhile his sudden loss of suction\nCarlotta knew meant a pump whose clicket's\nfailed in the way a clicket fails.\n\nBasra\n\n\"The way to relieve the tension\non the line to a windjammer\nis to lubricate the bollard\nso it's always a little slack . . .\"\nHer nonno giving us the inside track\non how the mule drivers whooped and hollered\non the dock. No respite from his yammer\non boundlessness being a bind\nand the most insidious kind\nof censorship self-censorship\nwhile he took Carlotta for a quick whip\nthrough conjugation, declension,\nand those other \"crannies of the crammer\"\nin which she'd been \"quite unscholared.\"\n\nBazentin\n\nAs I was bringing up her rear\na young dragoon would cock a snook\nat the gunners raking the knob\nof High Wood.
