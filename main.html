    <blockquote>
        <q>Sometimes only a poem will do. These poetic prescriptions and wise words of advice offer comfort, delight and
            inspiration for all; a space for reflection, and that precious realization: 'I'm not the only one who feels
            like
            this.'</q>
        <cite>- Alain de Botton</cite>

        'Truly a marvellous collection ... There is balm for the soul, fire for the belly, a cooling compress for the
        fevered brow, solace for the wounded, an arm around the lonely shoulder - the whole collection is a matchless
        compound of hug, tonic and kiss' Stephen Fry
    </p>

        In the years since he first had the idea of prescribing short, powerful poems for all manner of spiritual
        ailments,
        William Sieghart has taken his Poetry Pharmacy around the length and breadth of Britain, into the pages of the
        Guardian, onto BBC Radio 4 and onto the television, honing his prescriptions all the time. This pocket-sized
        book
        presents the most essential poems in his dispensary: those which, again and again, have really shown themselves
        to
        work. Whether you are suffering from loneliness, lack of courage, heartbreak, hopelessness, or even from an
        excess
        of ego, there is something here to ease your pain.

    <blockquote>
        <q>What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when
            the
            sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say:
            'Sing
            again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the
            cry
            would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful.</q>
